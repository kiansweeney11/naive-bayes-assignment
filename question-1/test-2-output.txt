Sentence African immigration to the United States refers to immigrants to the United States who are or were nationals of Africa .
The term African in the scope of this article refers to geographical or national origins rather than racial affiliation.
From the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 to 2007, an estimated total of 0.8 to 0.9 million Africans immigrated to the United States, accounting for roughly 3.3% of total immigration to the United States during this period.
African immigrants in the United States come from almost all regions in Africa and do not constitute a homogeneous group.
They include people from different national, linguistic, ethnic, racial, cultural and social backgrounds.
As such, African immigrants are to be distinguished from African American people, the latter of whom are descendants of mostly West and Central Africans who were involuntarily brought to the United States by means of the historic Atlantic slave trade .
A prison (from Old French prisoun), also known as gaol or jail, is a place in which people are physically confined and usually deprived of a range of personal freedoms .
Imprisonment or incarceration is a legal penalty that may be imposed by the state for the commission of a crime .
Other terms used are penitentiary, correctional facility, remand centre, detention centre, and gaol or jail.
In some legal systems some of these terms have distinct meanings.
A criminal suspect who has been charged with or is likely to be charged with criminal offense may be held on remand in prison if he or she is denied or unable to meet conditions of bail , or is unable or unwilling to post bail.
A criminal defendant may also be held in prison while awaiting trial or a trial verdict .
If found guilty, a defendant will be convicted and may receive a custodial sentence requiring imprisonment.
As well as convicted or suspected criminals, prisons may be used for internment of those not charged with a crime.
Prisons may also be used as a tool of political repression to detain political prisoners , prisoners of conscience , and " enemies of the state ", particularly by authoritarian regimes.
In times of war or conflict, prisoners of war may also be detained in prisons.
A prison system is the organizational arrangement of the provision and operation of prisons.
A small, electrically powered pump A large, electrically driven pump (electropump) for waterworks near the Hengsteysee , Germany .
A pump is a device that moves fluids ( liquids or gases ), or sometimes slurries , by mechanical action.
Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid: direct lift, displacement, and gravity pumps.
Pumps operate by some mechanism (typically reciprocating or rotary ), and consume energy to perform mechanical work by moving the fluid.
Pumps operate via many energy sources, including manual operation, electricity, engines , or wind power .
Lolita is a 1962 comedy-drama film by Stanley Kubrick based on the classic novel of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov , centres around a middle-aged man who becomes obsessed with a teenage girl.
The film stars James Mason as Humbert Humbert, Sue Lyon as Dolores Haze (Lolita) and Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze with Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty.
Due to the MPAA 's restrictions at the time , the film toned down the more provocative aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination.
The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon , was fourteen at the time of filming. Kubrick later commented that, had he realized how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, he probably never would have made the film.
Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key.
An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .
The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen .
Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision.
Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival).
The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .
Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell .
Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.
In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding.
Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.
Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably.
Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains .
There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess.
Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist.
This region is known as the hypervariable region.
Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen.
This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.
The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity.
Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.
Alicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981), known professionally as Alicia Keys, is an American R&B singer- songwriter , musician, record producer and actress.

She made her film debut in Smokin' Aces which included Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, Chris Pine, Ryan Reynolds, Taraji P.
Henson, Jeremy Piven and also went on to appear in The Nanny Diaries which starred Scarlett Johansson, Laura Linney, Paul Giamitti and Chris Evan in 2007.
Her third studio album, As I Am , was released in the same year and sold five million copies worldwide, earning Keys an additional three Grammy Awards.
The following year, she appeared in The Secret Life of Bees with Eva Longoria, Jennifer Hudson, Paul Bettany, Dakota Fanning, Queen Latifah which earned her a nomination at the NAACP Image Awards .
She released her fourth album, The Element of Freedom , in December 2009, which became Keys' first chart- topping album in the United Kingdom.
She released her fifth album, Girl on Fire , in November 2012, which became Keys' fifth chart-topping album in the United States.
Throughout her career, Keys has won numerous awards and has sold over 35 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide.
Billboard magazine named her the top R&B songs artist of the 2000s decade.
In 2010, VH1 included Keys on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.
Billboard magazine placed her number ten on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years.
BlackBerry (formerly RIM) named her as its Global Creative Director at the Blackberry 10 Experience event in New York City on January 30, 2013.
Keys then opened Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 3, 2013, by singing the U.S.
National Anthem .
At the 55th annual Grammy Awards, Keys performed with Maroon 5 singing a duet with their songs Daylight and Girl On Fire Sectioning a township .
Perfectly square full sections of farmland cover Central Indiana .
Satellite image of crops growing in Kansas , mainly using center pivot irrigation .
The primary grid pattern is of quarter sections (0.5 mi x 0.5 mi). In U.S. land surveying under the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), a section is an area nominally one square mile , containing , with 36 sections making up one survey township on a rectangular grid.
The legal description of a tract of land under the PLSS includes the name of the state , name of the county , township number, range number, section number, and portion of a section.
Sections are customarily surveyed into smaller squares by repeated halving and quartering.  In 1832 the smallest area of land that could be acquired was reduced to the 40 acre quarter-quarter section, and this size parcel became entrenched in American mythology.
After the Civil War Freedmen (freed slaves) were reckoned to be self- sufficient with " 40 acres and a mule ." In the 20th century real estate developers preferred working with 40 acre parcels.
The phrases "front 40" and "back 40," referring to farm fields, indicate quarter- quarter sections of land.
One of the reasons for creating sections of 640 acres was the ease of dividing into halves and quarters while still maintaining a whole number of acres.
A section can be halved seven times in this way, down to a parcel, or half of a quarter-quarter-quarter section—an easily surveyed 50 square chain area.
This system was of great practical value on the American frontier, where surveyors often had a shaky grasp of mathematics and were required to work quickly.
A description of a quarter-quarter section in standard abbreviated form, might look like "NW 1/4, NE 1/4, Sec. 34, T.3S, R.1W, 1st P.M.".
In expanded form this would read "the Northwest quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 34 of Township 3 South, Range 1 West, first Principal Meridian".
Juliet is one of the title characters in William Shakespeare 's romantic love tragedy Romeo and Juliet , the other being Romeo .
She serves as the play's female protagonist .
Juliet is the only daughter of Capulet , the patriarch of the Capulet family.
The story has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself.
Refractory bricks in a torpedo car used for hauling molten iron A fire brick, firebrick, or refractory brick is a block of refractory ceramic material used in lining furnaces , kilns , fireboxes , and fireplaces .
A refractory brick is built primarily to withstand high temperature, but will also usually have a low thermal conductivity for greater energy efficiency.
Usually dense firebricks are used in applications with extreme mechanical, chemical, or thermal stresses, such as the inside of a wood-fired kiln or a furnace, which is subject to abrasion from wood , fluxing from ash or slag, and high temperatures.
In other, less harsh situations, such as in an electric or natural gas fired kiln , more porous bricks, commonly known as "kiln bricks" are a better choice.
They are weaker, but they are much lighter, easier to form, and insulate far better than dense bricks.
In any case, firebricks should not spall under rapid temperature change, and their strength should hold up well during rapid temperature changes.
The peso ( sign : $; code : MXN) is the currency of Mexico .
Modern peso and dollar currencies have a common origin in the 15th–19th century Spanish dollar , most continuing to use its sign, "$" .
The Mexican peso is the 13th most traded currency in the world, the third most traded in the Americas , and the most traded currency in Latin America . The current ISO 4217 code for the peso is MXN; prior to the 1993 revaluation (see below), the code MXP was used.
The peso is subdivided into 100 centavos, represented by " ¢ ".
The name was originally used in reference to pesos oro (gold weights) or pesos plata (silver weights).
The literal English translation of the Spanish word peso is weight.
As of January 4, 2013, the peso's exchange rate was $16.5914 per euro and $12.7597 per U.S. dollar URL_http Mickie Laree James (born August 31, 1979) is an American professional wrestler and singer , currently signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where she is a former two-time TNA Women's Knockout Champion .
James began her professional wrestling career in 1999 as a valet on the independent circuit , where she was known under the name Alexis Laree.

Between WWE and TNA, James is an eight-time champion, and is also the only person to hold the WWE Women's, WWE Divas and TNA Knockout Championships in wrestling history.
Taste bud Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses .
Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with receptors of taste buds.
Taste, along with smell ( olfaction ) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (which also handles touch for texture, also pain, and temperature), determines flavors , the sensory impressions of food or other substances.
Humans perceive taste through sensory organs called taste buds , or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the top of the tongue .
The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are easily visible to the naked eye.
Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds, the organ of taste transduction.
There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.
Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat.
Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.
Taste perception fades with age: On average, people lose half their taste receptors by time they turn 20.
The sensation of taste can be categorized into five basic tastes: sweetness , sourness , saltiness , bitterness , and umami .
Taste buds are able to differentiate between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions.
Sweet, umami, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively.
As taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies.
Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.
The basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth — other factors include smell , detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture , detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors , muscle nerves, etc.; temperature, detected by thermoreceptors ; and "coolness" (such as of menthol ) and "hotness" ( pungency ), through chemesthesis .
Nesta Robert "Bob" Marley, OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician.
He was the rhythm guitarist and lead singer for the ska , rocksteady and reggae bands The Wailers (1963-1974) and Bob Marley & The Wailers (1974– 1981).
Marley remains the most widely known and the best-selling performer of reggae music, having sold more than 75 million albums worldwide.
He is also credited with helping spread both Jamaican music and the Rastafari movement to a worldwide audience.
Marley's music was heavily influenced by the social issues of his homeland, and he is considered to have given voice to the specific political and cultural nexus of Jamaica.
His best-known hits include " I Shot the Sheriff ", " No Woman, No Cry ", " Could You Be Loved ", "Duppy Conqueror", " Stir It Up ", " Get Up Stand Up ", " Jamming ", " Redemption Song ", " One Love ", and " Three Little Birds ", as well as the posthumous releases " Buffalo Soldier " and " Iron Lion Zion ".
The compilation album Legend (1984), released three years after his death, is reggae's best-selling album, going ten times Platinum which is also known as one Diamond in the U.S., and selling 25 million copies worldwide.

Workers and cattle in a slaughterhouse A slaughterhouse or abattoir or meatworks is a facility where animals are killed for consumption as food products .
Slaughterhouses which process meat not intended for human consumption are sometimes referred to as Knacker's yards or Knackeries.
In the United States, around nine billion animals are slaughtered every year. (this includes about 150.4 million cattle, bison, sheep, hogs, and goats and 8.9 billion chickens, turkeys, and ducks; in 2009, of beef were consumed in the U.S. alone. In Canada, 650 million animals are killed annually.
In the European Union, the annual figure is 300 million cattle , sheep , and pigs , and four billion (an unverified number) chickens .
Slaughtering animals on a large scale poses significant logistical problems and public health requirements.
Public aversion to meat packing in many cultures influences the location of slaughterhouses.
In addition, some religions stipulate certain conditions for the slaughter of animals.
There has been criticism of the methods of transport, preparation, herding, and killing within some slaughterhouses, and in particular of the speed with which the slaughter is sometimes conducted.
Investigations by animal welfare and animal rights groups have indicated that in some cases animals are skinned or gutted while alive and conscious.  In some cases animals are driven for hundreds of miles to slaughterhouses in conditions that often result in injuries and death en route.
Slaughtering animals is opposed by animal rights groups on ethical grounds.
A plot of a normal distribution (or bell- shaped curve) where each band has a width of 1 standard deviation – See also: 68-95-99.7 rule Cumulative probability of a normal distribution with expected value 0 and standard deviation 1.
In statistics and probability theory , standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, σ ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average ( mean ), or expected value.
A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean ; high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.
The standard deviation of a random variable , statistical population , data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance .
It is algebraically simpler though practically less robust than the average absolute deviation .
A useful property of standard deviation is that, unlike variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.
Note, however, that for measurements with percentage as unit, the standard deviation will have percentage points as unit.
In addition to expressing the variability of a population, standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions.
For example, the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times.
The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ​– the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval .
In science, researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant – normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation.
Standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment.
When only a sample of data from a population is available, the standard deviation of the population can be estimated by a modified quantity called the "sample standard deviation".
When the sample is the entire population, its unmodified standard deviation is called the "population standard deviation". A brain tumor, or tumour, is an intra cranial solid neoplasm , a tumor (defined as an abnormal growth of cells) within the brain or the central spinal canal .
Brain tumors include all tumors inside the cranium or in the central spinal canal.  They are created by an abnormal and uncontrolled cell division , usually in the brain itself, but also in lymphatic tissue, in blood vessels , in the cranial nerves , in the brain envelopes ( meninges ), skull , pituitary gland, or pineal gland .
Within the brain itself, the involved cells may be neurons or glial cells (which include astrocytes , oligodendrocytes , and ependymal cells ).
Brain tumors may also spread from cancers primarily located in other organs ( metastatic tumors ).
Any brain tumor is inherently serious and life-threatening because of its invasive and infiltrative character in the limited space of the intracranial cavity.
However, brain tumors (even malignant ones) are not invariably fatal, especially lipomas which are inherently benign.
Brain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be cancerous (malignant) or non- cancerous ( benign ); however, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differs from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non- cancerous neoplasms in the body.
Its threat level depends on the combination of factors like the type of tumor, its location, its size and its state of development.
Because the brain is well protected by the skull, the early detection of a brain tumor occurs only when diagnostic tools are directed at the intracranial cavity.
Usually detection occurs in advanced stages when the presence of the tumor has caused unexplained symptoms.
Primary (true) brain tumors are commonly located in the posterior cranial fossa in children and in the anterior two- thirds of the cerebral hemispheres in adults , although they can affect any part of the brain .
Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.
Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.
It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964.
A scene of volleyball play in an Erwadi village.
The complete rules are extensive.
But simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.
The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court.
The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.
Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.
The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally.
The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start the next rally.
A few of the most common faults include: The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body. A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures.
Interlibrary loan (abbreviated ILL, and sometimes called interloan, document delivery, or document supply) is a service whereby a user of one library can borrow books or receive photocopies of documents that are owned by another library.
The user makes a request with their local library, which, acting as an intermediary, identifies owners of the desired item, places the request, receives the item, makes it available to the user, and arranges for its return.
The lending library usually sets the due date and overdue fees of the material borrowed.
Although books and journal articles are the most frequently requested items, some libraries will lend audio recordings, video recordings, maps, sheet music, and microforms of all kinds.
In many cases, nominal fees accompany interlibrary loan services.
The term document delivery may also be used for a related service, namely the supply of journal articles and other copies on a personalized basis, whether these come from other libraries or direct from publishers.
The end user is usually responsible for any fees, such as costs for postage or photocopying.
Commercial document delivery services will borrow on behalf of any customer willing to pay their rates.

Harmon Clayton Killebrew (; June 29, 1936 – May 17, 2011), nicknamed "Killer" and "Hammerin' Harmon", was an American professional baseball first baseman , third baseman , and left fielder .
During his 22-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB), he played for the Washington Senators who later became the Minnesota Twins , and for the final season of his career, the Kansas City Royals .
When he retired, he was second only to Babe Ruth in American League (AL) home runs and was the AL career leader in home runs by a right-handed batter (since broken by Alex Rodriguez ).
He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984.
Killebrew was a 6-foot tall, 195-pound hitter with a compact swing that generated tremendous power.
He became one of the AL's most feared power hitters of the 1960s, hitting 40 home runs in a season eight times.
In 1965, he played in the World Series with the Minnesota Twins, who lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers .
His finest season was 1969, when he hit 49 home runs, recorded 140 runs batted in (RBI), and won the AL Most Valuable Player Award .
Killebrew led the league six times in home runs and three times in RBIs, and was named to eleven All-Star teams.
With quick hands and exceptional upper- body strength, Killebrew was known not just for the frequency of his home runs but also for their distance.
He hit the longest measured home runs at Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium , , and Baltimore's Memorial Stadium , , and was the first of just four batters to hit a baseball over the left field roof at Detroit's Tiger Stadium .
Despite his nicknames and his powerful style of play, Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet, kind man. Asked once what hobbies he had, Killebrew replied, "Just washing the dishes, I guess." After retiring from baseball, Killebrew became a television broadcaster for several baseball teams from 1976 to 1988, and also served as a hitting instructor for the Oakland Athletics .
He also divorced and remarried during this time, moving to Arizona in 1990 and chairing the Harmon Killebrew Foundation.
Killebrew was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December 2010, and died five months later.

The Waterboy is a 1998 American sports/comedy film directed by Frank Coraci (who played Robert 'Roberto' Boucher, Sr.), starring Adam Sandler , Kathy Bates , Fairuza Balk , Henry Winkler , Jerry Reed , Larry Gilliard, Jr. , Blake Clark , Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran , and produced by Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo .
This was Jerry Reed’s final film appearance.
He died Sept. 1, 2008, at the age of 71 from complications due to emphysema .
Lynn Swann , Lawrence Taylor , Jimmy Johnson , Bill Cowher , Paul Wight and Rob Schneider have cameo appearances.
The movie was extremely profitable, earning $161.5 million in North America alone.
This was Sandler's second film to eclipse $120 million worldwide in 1998 along with The Wedding Singer .
Adam Sandler's character, Bobby Boucher (pronounced "Boo-SHAY"), bears a strong resemblance to his "The Excited Southerner" comedic skits from his album " What the Hell Happened to Me? " The portrayal is one of a stereotypical Cajun from the bayous of South Louisiana, not the typical stereotype of a Southerner.
He also shares similarities in speech and mannerism to Canteen Boy , a recurring character, also portrayed by Adam Sandler, on Saturday Night Live .
Like Bobby, Canteen Boy preferred "purified water, right out of the old canteen", which he always carried with him.

Steel pipes Plastic (PVC) pipes in USA A pipe is a tubular section or hollow cylinder , usually but not necessarily of circular cross-section , used mainly to convey substances which can flow — liquids and gases (fluids), slurries, powders, masses of small solids.
It can also be used for structural applications; hollow pipe is far stiffer per unit weight than solid members.
In common usage the words pipe and tube are usually interchangeable, but in industry and engineering, the terms are uniquely defined.
Depending on the applicable standard to which it is manufactured, pipe is generally specified by a nominal diameter with a constant outside diameter (OD) and a schedule that defines the thickness.
Tube is most often specified by the OD and wall thickness, but may be specified by any two of OD, inside diameter (ID), and wall thickness. Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several international and national industrial standards.
While similar standards exist for specific industry application tubing, tube is often made to custom sizes and a broader range of diameters and tolerances.
Many industrial and government standards exist for the production of pipe and tubing.
The term "tube" is also commonly applied to non-cylindrical sections, i.e., square or rectangular tubing.
In general, "pipe" is the more common term in most of the world, whereas "tube" is more widely used in the United States.
Both "pipe" and "tube" imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a hose (or hosepipe) is usually portable and flexible.
Pipe assemblies are almost always constructed with the use of fittings such as elbows, tees, and so on, while tube may be formed or bent into custom configurations.
For materials that are inflexible, cannot be formed, or where construction is governed by codes or standards, tube assemblies are also constructed with the use of tube fittings.
Pertussis — commonly called whooping cough ( or ) — is a highly contagious bacterial disease caused by Bordetella pertussis .
In some countries, this disease is called the 100 days' cough or cough of 100 days.
Symptoms are initially mild, and then develop into severe coughing fits, which produce the namesake high-pitched "whoop" sound in infected babies and children when they inhale air after coughing.
The coughing stage lasts approximately six weeks before subsiding.
Prevention by vaccination is of primary importance given the seriousness of the disease in children.
Although treatment is of little direct benefit to the person infected, antibiotics are recommended because they shorten the duration of infectiousness.
It is estimated that the disease currently affects 48.5 million people yearly, resulting in nearly 295,000 deaths.
Listen to the sounds of pertussis and view personal stories of people affected by pertussis.
Spades is a trick-taking card game devised in the United States in the 1930s.
It can be played as either a partnership or solo/"cutthroat" game.
The object is to take at least the number of tricks that were bid before play of the hand began.
In partnership Spades, the bids and tricks taken are combined for a partnership.
Spades is a descendant of the Whist family of card games , which also includes Bridge , Hearts , and Oh, Hell .
Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trump, hence the name.
Cardiovascular disease (also called heart disease) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels ( arteries , capillaries , and veins ).
Cardiovascular disease refers to any disease that affects the cardiovascular system , principally cardiac disease, vascular diseases of the brain and kidney , and peripheral arterial disease.
The causes of cardiovascular disease are diverse but atherosclerosis and/or hypertension are the most common.
Additionally, with aging come a number of physiological and morphological changes that alter cardiovascular function and lead to subsequently increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even in healthy asymptomatic individuals. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths worldwide, though since the 1970s, cardiovascular mortality rates have declined in many high-income countries .
At the same time, cardiovascular deaths and disease have increased at a fast rate in low- and middle-income countries.
Although cardiovascular disease usually affects older adults, the antecedents of cardiovascular disease, notably atherosclerosis, begin in early life, making primary prevention efforts necessary from childhood.
There is therefore increased emphasis on preventing atherosclerosis by modifying risk factors, such as healthy eating , exercise , and avoidance of smoking .
The history of immigration to the United States is a continuing story of peoples from more populated continents, particularly Europe and also Africa and Asia, crossing oceans to the new land.
Historians do not treat the first indigenous settlers as immigrants.
Starting around 1600 British and other Europeans settled primarily on the east coast .
Later Africans were brought as slaves.
During the nation's history , the growing country experienced successive waves of immigration which rose and fell over time, particularly from Europe, with the cost of transoceanic transportation sometimes paid by travelers becoming indentured servants after their arrival in the New World.
At other times, immigration rules became more restrictive.
With the ending of numerical restrictions in 1965 and the advent of cheap air travel immigration has increased from Asia and Latin America.
Attitudes toward new immigrants have cycled between favorable and hostile since the 1790s.
The entrance of the CIA New Headquarters Building (NHB) of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is one of the principal intelligence- gathering agencies of the United States federal government .
It is an executive agency and reports directly to the Director of National Intelligence , with responsibility for providing national security intelligence assessment to senior United States policymakers .
Intelligence-gathering is performed by non-military commissioned civilian intelligence agents, many of whom are trained to avoid tactical situations.
The CIA also oversees and sometimes engages in tactical and covert activities at the request of the President of the United States.
Often, when such field operations are organized, the U.S. military or other warfare tacticians carry these tactical operations out on behalf of the agency while the CIA oversees them.
Although intelligence-gathering is the agency's main agenda, tactical divisions were established in the agency to carry out emergency field operations that require immediate suppression or dismantling of a threat or weapon.
The CIA's headquarters is located in Langley , McLean , Fairfax County, Virginia , a few miles west of Washington, D.C.. The CIA succeeded the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), formed during World War II to coordinate secret espionage activities against the Axis Powers for the branches of the United States Armed Forces .
The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA, affording it "no police or law enforcement functions, either at home or abroad".
Through interagency cooperation, the CIA has secret locations.
These locations are called "lily pads" by the Air Force. The primary function of the CIA is to collect information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals, and to advise public policymakers, but it does conduct emergency tactical operations and carries out covert operations , and exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Division .
There has been considerable criticism of the CIA relating to: security and counterintelligence failures, failures in intelligence analysis, human rights concerns, external investigations and document releases, influencing public opinion and law enforcement, drug trafficking, and lying to Congress.
Others, such as Eastern bloc defector Ion Mihai Pacepa , have defended the CIA as "by far the world’s best intelligence organization," and argued that CIA activities are subjected to scrutiny unprecedented among the world's intelligence agencies.
The smoot () is a nonstandard unit of length created as part of an MIT fraternity prank .
It is named after Oliver R.
Smoot , a fraternity pledge to Lambda Chi Alpha , who in October 1958 lay on the Harvard Bridge (between Boston and Cambridge , Massachusetts ), and was used by his fraternity brothers to measure the length of the bridge.
The Harvard Bridge, looking towards Boston.
Sir Galahad as conceived by George Frederick Watts (1817–1904).
Sir Galahad (; Middle Welsh : Gwalchavad, sometimes referred to as Galeas () or Galath ()), in Arthurian legend , is a knight of King Arthur 's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail .
He is the illegitimate son of Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic , and is renowned for his gallantry and purity.
Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, he is perhaps the knightly embodiment of Jesus in the Arthurian legends.
Sir Galahad first appears in the Lancelot–Grail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post- Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory 's Le Morte d'Arthur .
A league is a unit of length (or, rarely, area ).
It was long common in Europe and Latin America , but it is no longer an official unit in any nation.  The league originally referred to the distance a person could walk in an hour .
Since the Middle Ages, many values have been specified in several countries.
In the context of nautical distances, the 3 mile (4.8 km) distance corresponds to how far an observer of average height (5'9" or 1.78 m) can see when standing at sea level.
Thus, a ship traveling one "league" has reached what was previously the farthest visible distance on the horizon.
The lack of a historical and global standard for the exact measure of a "league" can be accounted for by the variable elevation of the observer (i.e., sightings from a ship's deck vs. masthead).
Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft .
As a database, it is a software product whose primary function is to store and retrieve data as requested by other software applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer across a network (including the Internet).
There are at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft SQL Server aimed at different audiences and for different workloads (ranging from small applications that store and retrieve data on the same computer, to millions of users and computers that access huge amounts of data from the Internet at the same time).
Its primary query languages are T-SQL and ANSI SQL . Don't be evil" is the informal corporate motto (or slogan) of Google . 0 Q182 what does google don't be evil mean?
D182 Don't be evil D182-1 It was first suggested either by Google employee Paul Buchheit at meeting about corporate values in early 2000, or according to another account by Google engineer Amit Patel in 1999. 0 Q182 what does google don't be evil mean?
D182 Don't be evil D182-2 Buchheit, the creator of Gmail , said he "wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take out", adding that the slogan was "also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent.
While the official corporate philosophy of Google does not contain the words "Don't be evil", they were included in the prospectus (aka "S-1") of Google's 2004 IPO (a letter from Google's founders, later called the "'Don't Be Evil' manifesto"): "Don’t be evil.
We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served — as shareholders and in all other ways — by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains." The sixth point of the 10-point corporate philosophy of Google says "You can make money without doing evil." The motto is sometimes incorrectly stated as Do no evil.  While many companies have ethical codes to govern their conduct, Google claims to have made "Don't Be Evil" a central pillar of their identity, and part of their self-proclaimed core values.
Criticism of Google often includes a reference to "Don't be evil".
Deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae.
Species in the Cervidae family include white-tailed deer , mule deer such as black-tailed deer , elk , moose , red deer , reindeer (caribou), fallow deer , roe deer and chital .
Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer ) and also female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year.
In this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope ; these are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance.
The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families, Moschidae and Tragulidae , respectively.
Adoption of LTE technology as of May 8, 2012.
LTE, an initialism of long-term evolution, marketed as 4G LTE, is a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals.
It is based on the GSM / EDGE and UMTS / HSPA network technologies, increasing the capacity and speed using a different radio interface together with core network improvements.
The standard is developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) and is specified in its Release 8 document series, with minor enhancements described in Release 9.
The world's first publicly available LTE service was launched by TeliaSonera in Oslo and Stockholm on December 14 2009.
LTE is the natural upgrade path for carriers with both GSM/UMTS networks and CDMA networks such as Verizon Wireless , who launched the first large- scale LTE network in North America in 2010, and au by KDDI in Japan have announced they will migrate to LTE. LTE is, therefore, anticipated to become the first truly global mobile phone standard, although the use of different frequency bands in different countries will mean that only multi-band phones will be able to use LTE in all countries where it is supported. Although marketed as a 4G wireless service, LTE as specified in the 3GPP Release 8 and 9 document series does not satisfy the technical requirements the 3GPP consortium has adopted for its new standard generation, and which were originally set forth by the ITU-R organization in its IMT-Advanced specification.
However, due to marketing pressures and the significant advancements that WIMAX , HSPA+ and LTE bring to the original 3G technologies, ITU later decided that LTE together with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies.  The LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the ITU-R requirements to be considered IMT-Advanced .
And to differentiate LTE-Advanced and WiMAX-Advanced from current 4G technologies, ITU has defined them as "True 4G". A run-flat tire is a pneumatic vehicle tire that is designed to resist the effects of deflation when punctured, and to enable the vehicle to continue to be driven at reduced speeds (up to ), and for limited distances of up to , or even depending on the type of tire.
Cooperstown is a village in Otsego County, New York , United States .
It is the county seat .
Most of the village lies within the town of Otsego , but some of the eastern part is in the town of Middlefield .
Cooperstown is best known as the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum .
The Farmers' Museum , the Fenimore Art Museum , Glimmerglass Opera , and the New York State Historical Association are also based there.
Most of the historic pre-1900 core of the village is included in the Cooperstown Historic District , which was designated to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and had its boundaries increased in 1997.
The population of the village was 1,852 at the 2010 census .
Bass fishing is the activity of angling for the North American gamefish known colloquially as the black bass.
There are numerous black bass species considered as gamefish in North America, including largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), Spotted bass or Kentucky bass (Micropterus punctatus), Guadalupe bass (Micropterus treculii), and many other species and subspecies of the genus Micropterus.
Though referred to as bass , all are actually members of the sunfish family ( Centrarchidae : order Perciformes ).
Modern bass fishing has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.
The sport has changed drastically since its beginnings in the late 19th century.
From humble beginnings, the black bass has become the second most specifically sought-after game fish in the United States .
The sport has driven the development of all manner of fishing gear, including rods, reels, lines, lures, electronic depth and fish-finding instruments, drift boats, float tubes, and specialized bass boats.
For many immigrants, the Statue of Liberty was their first view of the United States, signifying new opportunities in life.
The statue is an iconic symbol of the American Dream.
The American Dream is a national ethos of the United States , a set of ideals in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, and an upward social mobility achieved through hard work.
In the definition of the American Dream by James Truslow Adams in 1931, "life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth. The idea of the American Dream is rooted in the United States Declaration of Independence which proclaims that " all men are created equal " and that they are "endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights" including "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." The President of the United States of America (POTUS) is the head of state and head of government of the United States .
The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces .
Article II of the U.S.
Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the president and charges him with the execution of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers, with the advice and consent of the Senate .
The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves , and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances.
Since the founding of the United States, the power of the president and the federal government have grown substantially and each modern president, despite possessing no formal legislative powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills, is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of his party and the foreign and domestic policy of the United States.
The president is frequently described as the most powerful person in the world.
The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four-year term, and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers, the other being the Vice President of the United States .
The Twenty-second Amendment , adopted in 1951, prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third full term.
It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president, or acting president , for more than two years of another person's term as president.
In all, 43 individuals have served 55 four-year terms.
On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama became the 44th and current president.
On November 6, 2012, he was re- elected and is scheduled to serve until January 20, 2017.
Righteousness (also called rectitude) is an important theological concept in Christianity , Judaism , Islam , Hinduism (dharma), and Zoroastrianism .
It is an attribute that implies that a person's actions are justified, and can have the connotation that the person has been "judged" or "reckoned" as leading a life that is pleasing to the god/s portrayed in these belief systems.
William Tyndale remodelled the word after an earlier word rihtwis, which would have yielded modern English *rightwise or *rightways.
He used it to translate the Hebrew root ‫( צדקים‬TzDYQ), tzedek , which appears more than five hundred times in the Hebrew Bible , and the Greek word (dikaios), which appears more than two hundred times in the New Testament .
Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev (; born 14 September 1965) is the tenth and current Prime Minister of Russia , incumbent since 2012.
He previously served as the third President of Russia , from 2008 to 2012.
When he took office at the age of 42, he was the youngest of the three Russian Presidents who have served.
Born to a family of academics, Medvedev graduated from the Law Department of Leningrad State University in 1987. He defended his dissertation in 1990 and worked as a docent at his alma mater, now renamed to Saint Petersburg State University , where he taught civil and Roman law until 1999.
Medvedev's political career began as the election campaign manager and later an adviser of St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak .
During this time, Medvedev befriended Vladimir Putin .
In November 1999, Medvedev was hired in the Russian presidential administration , where he worked as deputy chief of staff.
In the 2000 Presidential elections , Medvedev was Putin's campaign manager.
On 14 November 2005, Medvedev was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister and was tasked with overseeing National Priority Projects .
He also worked as the Chairman of Gazprom 's board of directors, a post which he held until 2008.
On 10 December 2007, Medvedev was informally endorsed as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections by four political parties : United Russia , Fair Russia , Agrarian Party of Russia and Civilian Power , and was officially endorsed by United Russia on 17 December 2007.
Medvedev's candidacy was backed by the popular outgoing President Vladimir Putin, giving a significant boost to his popularity.
The 2008 presidential election , held on 2 March 2008, was won by Medvedev with 70.28% of the popular vote, and he was inaugurated on 7 May 2008.
Although he did not run for a second term as President, Medvedev was appointed Prime Minister by Putin, who won the 2012 presidential election .
On 26 May 2012 he also was appointed officially as the Leader of United Russia Party.
Widely regarded as more liberal than his predecessor, Medvedev's top agenda as President was a wide-ranging modernisation programme , aiming at modernising Russia's economy and society, and lessening the country's reliance on oil and gas.
During Medvedev's tenure, Russia emerged victorious in the 2008 South Ossetia war and recovered from the late- 2000s recession .
Recognising corruption as one of Russia's most severe problems, Medvedev has launched an anti- corruption campaign and initiated a substantial law enforcement reform .
In foreign policy, his main achievements include the signing of the New START treaty, a "reset" of the Russia – United States relations which were severely strained following Russia's war with Georgia, as well as increasing Russia's cooperation with the BRICS-countries , as well as Russia 's admission into the WTO in 2011.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as chronic renal disease, is a progressive loss in renal function over a period of months or years.
The symptoms of worsening kidney function are non-specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite .
Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a blood relative with chronic kidney disease.
Chronic kidney disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease , anemia or pericarditis .
Chronic kidney disease is identified by a blood test for creatinine .
Higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate and as a result a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products. Creatinine levels may be normal in the early stages of CKD, and the condition is discovered if urinalysis (testing of a urine sample) shows that the kidney is allowing the loss of protein or red blood cells into the urine.
To fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of medical imaging , blood tests and often renal biopsy (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed to find out if there is a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction.
Recent professional guidelines classify the severity of chronic kidney disease in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated.
Stage 5 CKD is often called End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and is synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic kidney failure (CKF) or chronic renal failure (CRF). There is no specific treatment unequivocally shown to slow the worsening of chronic kidney disease.
If there is an underlying cause to CKD, such as vasculitis , this may be treated directly to slow the damage.
In more advanced stages, treatments may be required for anemia and bone disease .
Severe CKD requires renal replacement therapy , which may involve a form of dialysis , but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant .
MISSE's logo The Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE), is a series of experiments mounted externally on the International Space Station (ISS) that investigates the effects of long-term exposure of materials to the harsh space environment.
The MISSE project evaluates the performance, stability, and long-term survivability of materials and components planned for use by NASA, commercial companies and the Department of Defense (DOD) on future low Earth orbit (LEO), synchronous orbit and interplanetary space missions.
The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), which was retrieved in 1990 after spending 68 months in LEO, revealed that space environments are very hostile to many spacecraft materials and components.
Atomic oxygen , which is the most prevalent atomic species encountered in low earth orbit, is highly reactive with plastics and some metals, causing severe erosion .
There is also extreme ultraviolet radiation due to the lack of an atmospheric filter .
This radiation deteriorates and darkens many plastics and coatings.
The vacuum in space also alters the physical properties of many materials.
Impacts of meteoroids and orbiting man- made debris can damage all materials exposed in space.
The combined effects of all of these environments on spacecraft can only be investigated in space.
MISSE evaluates materials currently being used and those planned for use in future space missions.
MISSE is a direct successor of the Mir Environmental Effects Payloads (MEEP) that were attached for over a year to the Mir Docking Module of the space station Mir between shuttle flights STS-76 and STS-86 ; and is a descendant of the Long Duration Exposure Facility .
Also MEEPS can trace their inception to the Passive Optical Sample Array (POSA) sample trays flown on STS-1 and STS-2 , and their successor Effects of Oxygen Interaction with Materials (EOIM) on STS-3 and STS-5 .
MISSE PEC closed MISSE PEC closed Crater Lake is a caldera lake located in the south-central region of the U.S. state of Oregon . It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and famous for its deep blue color and water clarity.
The lake partly fills a nearly deep caldera that was formed around 7,700 (± 150) years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama .
Human interaction is traceable back to the indigenous Native Americans witnessing the eruption of Mount Mazama.
There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years.
At 1,943 feet (592 meters), it is the deepest lake in the United States, and the seventh deepest in the world.
Crater Lake is known for the " Old Man of the Lake ", a full-sized tree which is now a stump that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century.
The low temperature of the water has slowed the decomposition of the wood, hence the longevity of the bobbing tree.
Two islands are in Crater Lake, with Wizard Island from a cinder cone that erupted after Crater Lake began to fill with water, and Phantom Ship Island with seven different trees living on it.
There are also colonies of violet green swallows, and several varieties of wildflowers and lichens living there.
While having no indigenous fish population, the lake was stocked from 1888 to 1941 with a variety of fish.
Several species have formed self- sustaining populations.
Since 2002, one of the state's regular- issue license plate designs has featured Crater Lake.
The commemorative Oregon State Quarter , which was released by the United States Mint in 2005, features an on its reverse.
Dim sum () refers to a style of Cantonese food prepared as small bite- sized or individual portions of food traditionally served in small steamer baskets or on small plates.
Dim sum is also well known for the unique way it is served in some restaurants, wherein fully cooked and ready-to-serve dim sum dishes are carted around the restaurant for customers to choose their orders while seated at their tables.
Eating dim sum at a restaurant is usually known in Cantonese as going to "drink tea" ( yum cha , ), as tea is typically served with dim sum.
Close up of a human iris Eye color is a polygenic phenotypic character determined by two distinct factors: the pigmentation of the eye 's iris and the frequency-dependence of the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris .
In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black, depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium (located on the back of the iris), the melanin content within the iris stroma (located at the front of the iris), and the cellular density of the stroma.
The appearance of blue, green, as well as hazel eyes results from the Rayleigh scattering of light in the stroma, a phenomenon similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the sky.
Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or ocular fluid.  Eye color is thus an instance of structural color and varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-colored eyes.
The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments, such as pteridines , purines , and carotenoids .
Humans and other animals have many phenotypic variations in eye color.
The genetics of eye color are complicated, and color is determined by multiple genes.
So far, as many as 15 genes have been associated with eye color inheritance. Some of the eye-color genes include OCA2 and HERC2. The once-held view that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect.
The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur.
However, OCA2 gene polymorphism, close to proximal 5′ regulatory region, explains most human eye-color variation.
Texas Southern University (shortened to Texas Southern or simply TSU) is a historically black university (HBCU) located in Houston , Texas , United States, accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools .
The University was established in 1927 as the Houston Colored Junior College, through its private college phase as Houston Colored College.
On March 3, 1947, the state declared this to be the first state university in Houston and it was renamed Texas State University for Negroes.
In 1951, the name changed to Texas Southern University.
Texas Southern University is one of the largest and most comprehensive HBCUs in the nation and one of only four independent public universities in Texas (those not affiliated with any of Texas' six public university systems).
TSU is the only HBCU in Texas recognized as one of America's Top Colleges by Forbes .
TSU is also recognized as the leading producer of college degrees to African- Americans and Hispanics in Texas and ranks fourth (4th) in the nation in African-American conferred doctoral and professional degrees.
The University is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund .
The 1976 Republician National Convention was a United States political convention of the Republican Party that met from August 16 to August 19, 1976 to select the party's nominee for President .
Held in Kemper Arena in Kansas City , Missouri , the convention nominated President Gerald Ford for a full term, but only after narrowly defeating a strong challenge from former California Governor Ronald Reagan .
The convention also nominated Senator Robert J.
Dole of Kansas for Vice President , instead of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller .
The keynote address was delivered by Tennessee Senator Howard Baker .  Dottie West (October 11, 1932 – September 4, 1991) was an American country music singer and songwriter.
Along with her friends and co-recording artists Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn , she is considered one of the genre's most influential and groundbreaking female artists.
Dottie West's career started in the early 1960s, with her Top 10 hit, " Here Comes My Baby Back Again ," which won her the first Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1965.
In the 1960s, West was one of the few female country singers working in what was then a male-dominated industry, influencing other female country singers like Lynn Anderson , Crystal Gayle , Barbara Mandrell , Dolly Parton , and Tammy Wynette .
Throughout the 1960s, West had country hits within the Top 10 and 20.
In the early 1970s, West wrote a popular commercial for the Coca-Cola company, titled " Country Sunshine ", which she nearly brought to the top of the charts in 1973.
In the late-70s, she teamed up with country-pop superstar, Kenny Rogers for a series of duets, which brought her career in directions it had never gone before, earning Platinum selling albums and No. 1 records for the very first time. Her duet recordings with Rogers, like " Every Time Two Fools Collide ," " All I Ever Need Is You ," and " What Are We Doin' In Love ," eventually became country-music standards.
In the mid-1970s, her image and music underwent a major metamorphosis, bringing her to the very peak of her popularity as a solo act, and reaching No. 1 for the very first time on her own in 1980 with " A Lesson in Leavin' ".
Baby Ruth is an American candy bar made of peanuts , caramel and chocolate-flavored nougat covered in chocolate .
It is owned by the Swiss company Nestlé In 1921, the Curtiss Candy Company refashioned its Kandy Kake into the Baby Ruth.
The bar was a staple of the Chicago - based company for some seven decades.
Curtiss was purchased by Nabisco in 1981.
In 1990, RJR Nabisco sold the Curtiss brands to Nestlé .
Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen , first published in 1813.
The story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with issues of manners , upbringing, morality , education , and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th- century England .
Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire , near London .
Though the story is set at the turn of the 19th century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of "most loved books" such as The Big Read .
It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature and receives considerable attention from literary scholars .
Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes.
To date, the book has sold some 20 million copies worldwide.
As Anna Quindlen wrote, "Pride and Prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels consider, the search for self.
And it is the first great novel to teach us that that search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the public punishment of adultery ." Payment card numbers are found on payment cards , such as credit cards and debit cards , as well as stored-value cards , gift cards and other similar cards.
Some card issuers refers to the card number as the primary account number or PAN. They have a certain level of internal structure and share a common numbering scheme .
Bank card numbers are allocated in accordance with ISO/IEC 7812 .
The bank card number merely identifies the card, which is then electronically associated by the issuing organisation with one of its customers and then to the customer's designated bank account /s.
In the case of stored-value type cards, there is no necessary association with a particular customer.
An ISO/IEC 7812 card number is typically 16 digits in length, and consists of: A cheque (or check in American English ) is a document that orders a payment of money from a bank account.
The person writing the cheque, the drawer , usually has a current account (most English speaking countries) or checking account (US) where their money was previously deposited.
The drawer writes the various details including the monetary amount, date, and a payee on the cheque, and signs it, ordering their bank , known as the drawee, to pay that person or company the amount of money stated. Cheques are a type of bill of exchange and were developed as a way to make payments without the need to carry large amounts of money.
While paper money evolved from promissory notes , another form of negotiable instrument, similar to cheques in that they were originally a written order to pay the given amount to whoever had it in their possession (the " bearer ").
Technically, a cheque is a negotiable instrument instructing a financial institution to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified transactional account held in the drawer's name with that institution.
Both the drawer and payee may be natural persons or legal entities .
Specifically, cheques are order instruments, and are not in general payable simply to the bearer (as bearer instruments are) but must be paid to the payee.
In some countries, such as the US, the payee may endorse the cheque, allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid.
Although forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the 9th century, it was during the 20th century that cheques became a highly popular non- cash method for making payments and the usage of cheques peaked.
By the second half of the 20th century, as cheque processing became automated, billions of cheques were issued annually; these volumes peaked in or around the early 1990s.
Since then cheque usage has fallen, being partly replaced by electronic payment systems.
In some countries like Poland and Ukraine cheques have become a marginal payment system or have been phased out completely.
Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is an American professional tennis player currently ranked no. 1 in women's singles tennis.

American wire gauge (AWG), also known as the Brown & Sharpe wire gauge, is a standardized wire gauge system used since 1857 predominantly in the United States and Canada for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire. The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its current-carrying capacity .
The steel industry does not use AWG and prefers a number of other wire gauges.
These include Washburn & Moen (or W&M) Wire Gauge, US Steel Wire Gauge, and Music Wire Gauge (see Piano wire ).
Increasing gauge numbers give decreasing wire diameters, which is similar to many other non- metric gauging systems.
This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire.
Very fine wire (for example, 30 gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than did 0 gauge wire.
Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.
The AWG tables are for a single, solid, round conductor.
The AWG of a stranded wire is determined by the total cross-sectional area of the conductor, which determines its current-carrying capacity and electrical resistance .
Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG. AWG is also commonly used to specify body piercing jewelry sizes (especially smaller sizes), even when the material is not metallic.
The Giant's Causeway (known as Clochán an Aifir or Clochán na bhFomhórach in Irish and tha Giant's Causey in Ulster-Scots ) is an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns , the result of an ancient volcanic eruption.
It is located in County Antrim on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland , about three miles (4.8 km) northeast of the town of Bushmills .
It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986, and a National Nature Reserve in 1987 by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland .
In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, the Giant's Causeway was named as the fourth greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom .
The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the cliff foot and disappear under the sea.
Most of the columns are hexagonal , although there are also some with four, five, seven or eight sides.
The tallest are about 12 metres (39 ft) high, and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres thick in places.
The Giant's Causeway is today owned and managed by the National Trust and it is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern Ireland .
Spiced strips of jerky Jerky is lean meat that has been trimmed of fat, cut into strips, and then dried to prevent spoilage.
Normally, this drying includes the addition of salt, to prevent bacteria from developing on the meat before sufficient moisture has been removed.
The word "jerky" is derived from the Spanish word charqui which is from the Quechua word ch'arki.
All that is needed to produce basic "jerky" is a low-temperature drying method, and salt to inhibit bacterial growth.
Modern manufactured jerky is normally marinated in a seasoned spice rub or liquid, and dried, dehydrated or smoked with low heat (usually under 70 °C/160 °F). Some makers still use just salt and sun- dry fresh sliced meat to make jerky.
Some product manufacturers finely grind meat, mix in seasonings, and press the meat-paste into flat shapes prior to drying. The resulting jerky from the above methods would be a salty and/or savory snack.
However, often a sweet or semi-sweet recipe is used, with sugar being a major ingredient (in contrast to biltong which is a dried meat product that utilizes the acid in vinegar rather than salt to inhibit bacterial growth when drying the meat).
Jerky is ready-to-eat and needs no additional preparation.
It can be stored for months without refrigeration .
When the protein to moisture content ratio is correct, the resulting meat is cured , or preserved.
There are many products in the marketplace which are sold as jerky which consist of highly processed, chopped and formed meat, rather than traditional sliced, whole-muscle meat.
These products may contain more fat, but moisture content, like the whole- muscle product, must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture to protein ratio in the US. Chemical preservatives can be used to prevent oxidative spoilage, but the moisture to protein ratio prevents microbial spoilage by low water activity .
Many jerky products are very high in sugar and are therefore very sweet, unlike biltong, which rarely contains added sugars.
A typical 30 g portion of fresh jerky contains 10-15 g of protein, 1 g of fat, and 0-3 g of carbohydrates.
Since traditional jerky recipes use a basic salt cure, sodium can be a concern for some people.
A 30 g serving of jerky could contain more than 600 mg of sodium, which would be about 30% of the recommended USRDA . Monument of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler in Prague Tycho Brahe (14 December 154624 October 1601), born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations.
He was born in Scania , then part of Denmark, now part of modern-day Sweden.
Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist .
In his De nova stella (On the new star) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm .
His precise measurements indicated that "new stars," (stellae novae , now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572 , lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena, and were therefore not "atmospheric" tailless comets as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and moon.
Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly "immutable" celestial spheres .
As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system .
Furthermore, he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers, working without telescopes for his observations.
Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg , an early research institute , where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later Stjerneborg , underground, when he discovered that his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady.
On the island (on which he demonstrated autocratic character and behavior toward the residents) he founded manufactories such as paper- making to provide material for printing his results. After disagreements with the new Danish king Christian IV in 1597, he was invited by the Bohemian king and Holy Roman emperor Rudolph II to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer.
He built the new observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou .
Here, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by Johannes Kepler who later used Tycho's astronomical data to develop Kepler's laws of planetary motion .

Dylan Thomas Sprouse and Cole Mitchell Sprouse (born August 4, 1992) are American actors.
They are twins and are collectively referred to as Dylan and Cole Sprouse or the Sprouse brothers, usually abbreviated as Sprouse Bros.
Their first major theatrical film role was in Big Daddy , where they starred alongside Adam Sandler .
They later appeared in several television sitcoms and starred in the straight-to- DVD films, I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus and Just for Kicks .
In 2005, they starred in the Disney Channel sitcom The Suite Life of Zack & Cody .
As a result of the series' success, the media has termed them "heartthrobs" and "overwhelming draws" among preteen and teen audiences.
The following year, the brothers launched a franchise known as the Sprouse Bros brand, which included a clothing line, book series and magazine.
The majority of the Sprouses' franchise ended in 2008, except for their clothing line.
The Suite Life of Zack & Cody was retooled in 2008 as The Suite Life on Deck , in which the brothers reprised their roles as Zack and Cody.
The Suite Life on Deck went on to become the most-watched tween/children's television show in 2008 and 2009.
The show ended in May 2011.
They also starred in the The Suite Life Movie, which aired in March of the same year.
They began cultivating an adult image by starring in the independent theatrical suspense film, The Kings of Appletown in 2009. Dylan and Cole were two of the wealthiest children alive in 2007, and in 2010, the Sprouse brothers were the highest paid teenage Disney television actors, earning $40,000 per episode combined.
MSN reported by the end of the 2000s that the twin brothers became the richest teenage twins in the world.
In 2010, the brothers were accepted to New York University .
They deferred admission for one year, and they began attending the university in the fall of 2011.
The Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American horror film written and directed by Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick .
The film was produced by the Haxan Films production company.
Though fictional, it is presented as " found footage ", as if pieced together from amateur footage, and popularised this style of horror movie.
The film relates the story of three student filmmakers ( Heather Donahue , Joshua Leonard , and Michael C.
Williams ) who disappeared while hiking in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch.
The viewers are told the three were never seen or heard from again, although their video and sound equipment (along with most of the footage they shot) was discovered a year later by the police department and that this "recovered footage" is the film the viewer is watching.
The film received enormously positive reception from critics and went on to gross over US$248 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent movies of all time.
The DVD was released in December 1999 and presented only in full-screen.
A studio production film based on the theme of The Blair Witch Project was released on October 27, 2000 entitled Book of Shadows .
Another sequel was planned for the following year, but did not materialize.
On September 2, 2009, it was announced that Sánchez and Myrick were pitching the third film.
A trilogy of video games based on the film was released in 2000.
An 1870 oil painting by Ford Madox Brown depicting Romeo and Juliet famous balcony scene Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written early in the career of William Shakespeare about two young star- crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families.
It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet , is one of his most frequently performed plays.
Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.
Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity.
Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567.
Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but, to expand the plot, developed supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris .
Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597.
This text was of poor quality, and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original.
Shakespeare's use of his poetic dramatic structure , especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story, has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill.
The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.
Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical and opera.
During the English Restoration , it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant .
David Garrick 's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda 's operatic adaptation omitted much of the action and added a happy ending.
Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman 's, restored the original text, and focused on greater realism .
John Gielgud 's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text, and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama.
In the 20th century the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor 's comparatively faithful 1936 production , Franco Zeffirelli 's 1968 version , and Baz Luhrmann 's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet .
S.H.I.E.L.D. is a fictional espionage and law-enforcement agency in the Marvel Comics Universe .
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in Strange Tales #135 (Aug. 1965), it often deals with superhuman threats.
The acronym originally stood for Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage, Law-Enforcement Division.
It was changed in 1991 to Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate.
Within the various films set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe , as well as in the animated series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes , the acronym stands for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
The herons are long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species (some are called " egrets " or " bitterns " instead of "heron").
Within Ardeidae, all members of the genera Botaurus and Ixobrychus are referred to as "bitterns", and — including the Zigzag Heron or Zigzag Bittern — are a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae.
However, egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white and/or have decorative plumes.
Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller.
The classification of the individual heron/egret species is fraught with difficulty, and there is still no clear consensus about the correct placement of many species into either of the two major genera, Ardea and Egretta .
Similarly, the relationship of the genera in the family is not completely resolved.
However, one species formerly considered to constitute a separate monotypic family Cochlearidae, the Boat-billed Heron , is now regarded as a member of the Ardeidae.
Although herons resemble birds in some other families, such as the storks , ibises , spoonbills and cranes , they differ from these in flying with their necks retracted, not outstretched.
They are also one of the bird groups that have powder down .
Some members of this group nest colonially in trees, while others, notably the bitterns, use reedbeds.
Saint Patrick's Day or the Feast of Saint Patrick (, "the Day of the Festival of Patrick") is a cultural and religious holiday celebrated on 17 March.
It is named after Saint Patrick ( AD 385– 461), the most commonly recognised of the patron saints of Ireland .
Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early seventeenth century and is observed by the Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland ), the Eastern Orthodox Church and Lutheran Church . The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland , as well as celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general.
Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilithe , and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks .
Christians also attend church services , and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption.
Saint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland , Northern Ireland , Newfoundland and Labrador and Montserrat .
It is also widely celebrated by the Irish diaspora around the world; especially in Britain, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand.
The United States House of Representatives is one of the two houses of the United States Congress (a bicameral legislature ).
It is frequently referred to as the House.
The other house is the Senate .
The composition and powers of the House are established in Article One of the United States Constitution .
The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire country although its bills must also be passed by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S.
President before becoming law (unless both the House and Senate re-pass the legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber).
The House has several exclusive powers: the power to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials, and to elect the U.S.
President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College .
Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population but is entitled to at least one representative .
The most populous state, California , currently has 53 representatives.
The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435.
Each representative serves for a two- year term.
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , who presides over the chamber, is elected by the members of the House, and is therefore traditionally the leader of the House Democratic Caucus or the House Republican Conference , whichever party has more voting members.
The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol .
The Battle of the Sexes is a title given to three notable tennis matches between a male and a female player.
The first match was between Bobby Riggs and Margaret Court , over the best of three sets.
The second was a nationally televised match between Riggs and Billie Jean King , over the best of five sets.
The Riggs v King match was officially dubbed The Battle of the Sexes.
The final match was between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova , over the best of three sets and hybrid rules favouring the female player, which was dubbed The Battle of Champions.
Different religious groups include different books in their Biblical canons , in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books, or incorporate additional material into canonical books.
Christian Bibles range from the sixty-six books of the Protestant canon to the eighty-one books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon.
The Hebrew Bible , or Tanakh , contains twenty-four books divided into three parts; the five books of the Torah ("teaching" or "law"), the Nevi'im ("prophets"), and the Ketuvim ("writings").
The first part of Christian Bibles is the Old Testament , which contains, at minimum, the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible divided into thirty-nine books and ordered differently from the Hebrew Bible. The Catholic Church and Eastern Christian churches also hold certain deuterocanonical books and passages to be part of the Old Testament canon .
The second part is the New Testament , containing twenty-seven books; the four Canonical gospels , Acts of the Apostles , twenty-one Epistles or letters and the Book of Revelation .
The Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books.
The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive: if at least one Eastern church accepts the book it is included here.
Neutrophilia (or neutrophil leukocytosis) describes a high number of neutrophil granulocytes in blood .

Outdoor components of a residential air- source heat pump A heat pump is a device that transfers heat energy from a heat source to a heat sink against a temperature gradient.
Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite the direction of spontaneous heat flow.
A heat pump uses some amount of external high-grade energy to accomplish the desired transfer of thermal energy from heat source to heat sink.
While compressor-driven air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to HVAC devices used for space heating or space cooling.
When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic refrigeration- type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator but in the opposite direction, releasing heat into the conditioned- space rather than the surrounding environment.
In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.
During the twentieth century, women of the world became indispensable in the war efforts.
In many countries the need for female participation in the First World War was seen as almost necessary, as unprecedented numbers of men were wounded and killed.
In the Second World War , the need for women arose again.
Whether it was on the home front or the front-lines, for civilian or enlisted women, the World Wars started a new era for women's opportunities to contribute in war and be recognized for efforts outside of the home.
The Wire is an American television drama series set and produced in and around Baltimore , Maryland.
Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon , the series was broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States.
The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.
Each season of The Wire focuses on a different facet of the city of Baltimore.
In chronological order they are: the illegal drug trade , the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media.
The large cast consists mainly of character actors who are little known for their other roles. Simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama, the show is "really about the American city, and about how we live together.
It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals.
Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman , a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution they are committed to." Despite only receiving modest ratings and never winning major television awards, The Wire has been described by many critics as one of the greatest TV dramas of all time.
The show is recognized for its realistic portrayal of urban life, its literary ambitions, and its uncommonly deep exploration of sociopolitical themes.
This is a list of political parties in the United States , both past and present.
Jersey Shore is an American reality television series which ran on MTV from December 3, 2009 to December 20, 2012 in the United States.
The series follows the lives of eight housemates spending their summer at the Jersey Shore in the U.S. state of New Jersey .
Season 2 followed the cast escaping the cold northeast winter to Miami Beach , with Season 3 returning to the Jersey Shore.
The fourth season, filmed in Italy , premiered on August 4, 2011.
The show returned for a fifth season, at Seaside Heights on January 5, 2012.
The fifth season finale aired on March 15, 2012.
On March 19, 2012, MTV confirmed that the series would return for their sixth season.
On August 30, 2012, MTV announced that the series will end after the sixth season, which premiered on October 4.
The series finale aired on December 20, 2012.
The show debuted amid large amounts of controversy regarding the use of the words " Guido / Guidette ," portrayals of Italian-American stereotypes, and scrutiny from locals because the cast members were not residents of the area.
The series garnered record ratings for MTV, making it the network's most viewed series telecast ever.
The series' cast have also been credited with introducing unique lexicon and phrases into American popular culture.
The University of Chicago and the University of Oklahoma are among the educational institutions that have had classes or conferences about the show.
In 2010, the cast of Jersey Shore was named on Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People list, and the series has since been exported to dozens of countries worldwide.
There are several remakes of the show in other countries, with two set in the United Kingdom ; the well known Geordie Shore , set in Newcastle upon Tyne , England.
The other is The Valleys , the Welsh equivalent, which is filmed and set in Cardiff .
The only other official remake of the show is Gandía Shore , set in Gandía , Spain .
A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.
The two surviving species of camel are the dromedary , or one-humped camel, which is native to the Middle East and the Horn of Africa ; and the Bactrian , or two-humped camel, which inhabits Central Asia .
Both species have been domesticated; they provide milk , meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals .
Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm , at the entrance to the River Mersey in North West England.
The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm is a 845 megawatt (MW) wind farm in the U.S. state of Oregon . Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electrical power , windmills for mechanical power, wind pumps for water pumping or drainage , or sails to propel ships.
Large wind farms consist of hundreds of individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network.
Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher.
Small onshore wind farms provide electricity to isolated locations.
Utility companies increasingly buy surplus electricity produced by small domestic wind turbines.
Wind power, as an alternative to fossil fuels , is plentiful, renewable , widely distributed, clean , produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and uses little land.
The effects on the environment are generally less problematic than those from other power sources.
As of 2011, Denmark is generating more than a quarter of its electricity from wind and 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis.
In 2010 wind energy production was over 2.5% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing rapidly at more than 25% per annum.
The monetary cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations.
Wind power is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales.
The intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when used to supply up to 20% of total electricity demand, but as the proportion increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur.
Power management techniques such as having excess capacity storage, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing sources, storage such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity , exporting and importing power to neighboring areas or reducing demand when wind production is low, can greatly mitigate these problems.
In addition, weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.
Donald John Trump, Sr. (born June 14, 1946) is an American business magnate , television personality and author.
He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts .
Trump's extravagant lifestyle, outspoken manner, and role on the NBC reality show The Apprentice have made him a well-known celebrity who was No. 14 on the 2012 Forbes Celebrity 100 list.
Trump is the son of Fred Trump , a wealthy New York City real-estate developer.
He worked for his father's firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , and in 1968 officially joined the company.
He was given control of the company in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization.
In 2010, Trump expressed an interest in becoming a candidate for president of the United States in the 2012 election , though in May 2011, he announced he would not be a candidate.
In December 2011, Trump was suggested as a possible vice presidential selection by Michele Bachmann , if she were to win the Republican nomination.

Jacksonville is the largest city in the U.S. state of Florida by population and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States . It is the county seat of Duval County , with which the city government consolidated in 1968.
Consolidation gave Jacksonville its great size and placed most of its metropolitan population within the city limits; with an estimated population in 2011 of 827,908, it is the most populous city proper in Florida and the Southeast , and the eleventh most populous in the United States.
Jacksonville is the principal city in the Jacksonville metropolitan area , with a population of 1,345,596 in 2010.
Jacksonville is in the First Coast region of northeast Florida and is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River , about south of the Georgia state line and about north of Miami .
The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast.
The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline , one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States.
Under British rule , settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and Cowford to the British.
A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain ; it was named after Andrew Jackson , the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States .
Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port .
Its riverine location facilitates two U.S.
Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville , Florida's third largest seaport .
Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking , insurance , healthcare and logistics .
As with much of Florida, tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area, particularly tourism related to golf .
In 2010, Jacksonville was listed as a "High sufficiency" world city in the World Cities Study Group’s inventory.
It ranks alongside cities such as Liverpool and Las Vegas .
The blue color of liquid oxygen in a dewar flask Liquid oxygen — abbreviated LOx, LOX or Lox in the aerospace , submarine and gas industries — is one of the physical forms of elemental oxygen .
Sex reassignment surgery (initialized as SRS; also known as gender reassignment surgery (GRS), genital reconstruction surgery, sex affirmation surgery, sex realignment surgery or sex- change operation) is a term for the surgical procedures by which a person's physical appearance and function of their existing sexual characteristics are altered to resemble that of the other sex .
It is part of a treatment for gender identity disorder /gender dysphoria in transsexual and transgender people.
It may also be performed on intersex people, often in infancy and without their consent.
In a recent statement by the UN, it condemns the nonconsensual treatment of "normalization" surgery to treat intersexuality.
Other terms for SRS include sex reconstruction surgery, gender confirmation surgery, and more clinical terms, such as feminizing genitoplasty or penectomy, orchidectomy and vaginoplasty are used medically for trans women, with masculinizing genitoplasty or phalloplasty often similarly used for trans men.
People who pursue sex reassignment surgery are usually referred to as transsexual; "trans" - across, through, change; "sexual" - pertaining to the sexual (not sexual actions) of a person.
More recently, people pursuing SRS often identify as transgender instead of transsexual. Mount Everest (, Sagarmāthā; ; Chomolungma or Qomolangma "Holy Mother"; ;) is the Earth 's highest mountain , with a peak at above sea level and the 5th tallest mountain measured from the centre of the Earth .

Saint Patrick's Day or the Feast of Saint Patrick (, "the Day of the Festival of Patrick") is a cultural and religious holiday celebrated on 17 March.
It is named after Saint Patrick ( AD 385– 461), the most commonly recognised of the patron saints of Ireland .
Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early seventeenth century and is observed by the Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland ), the Eastern Orthodox Church and Lutheran Church .
The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland , as well as celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general.
Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilithe , and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks .
Christians also attend church services , and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption.
Saint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland , Northern Ireland , Newfoundland and Labrador and Montserrat .
It is also widely celebrated by the Irish diaspora around the world; especially in Britain, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. The Gallipoli Campaign, also known as the Dardanelles Campaign or the Battle of Gallipoli or the Battle of Çanakkale (), took place on the Gallipoli peninsula in the Ottoman Empire (now Gelibolu in modern day Turkey ) between 25 April 1915 and 9 January 1916, during the First World War .
A joint British and French operation was mounted to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ( Istanbul ) and secure a sea route to Russia .
The attempt failed, with heavy casualties on both sides.
The campaign was considered one of the greatest victories of the Turks and was reflected on as a major failure by the Allies .
The Gallipoli campaign resonated profoundly among all nations involved.
In Turkey, the battle is perceived as a defining moment in the history of the Turkish people—a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the ageing Ottoman Empire was crumbling.
The struggle laid the grounds for the Turkish War of Independence and the foundation of the Republic of Turkey eight years later under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , himself a commander at Gallipoli.
The campaign was the first major battle undertaken in the war by Australia and New Zealand, and is often considered to mark the birth of national consciousness in both of these countries.
Anzac Day , 25 April, remains the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in Australia and New Zealand, surpassing Armistice Day / Remembrance Day .
Vietnam (, , , ; ) officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (' ()), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia .
With an estimated 90.3 million inhabitants as of 2012, it is the world's 13th-most-populous country , and the eighth-most-populous Asian country .
The name Vietnam translates as "South Viet", and was officially adopted in 1945.
The country is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, and the South China Sea to the east.
Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976.
The Vietnamese became independent from Imperial China in 938 AD, following the Battle of Bạch Đằng River .
Successive Vietnamese royal dynasties flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century.
The First Indochina War eventually led to the expulsion of the French in 1954, leaving Vietnam divided politically into two states, North and South Vietnam.
Conflict between the two sides intensified, with heavy foreign intervention, during the Vietnam War , which ended with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975.
Vietnam was then unified under a Communist government, but was politically isolated and impoverished.
In 1986, the government initiated a series of economic and political reforms , which began Vietnam's path towards integration into the world economy.
By 2000, it had established diplomatic relations with most nations.
Vietnam's economic growth has been among the highest in the world since 2000, and in 2011 it had the highest Global Growth Generators Index among 11 major economies.
Its successful economic reforms resulted in it joining the World Trade Organization in 2007.
However, the country still suffers from relatively high levels of income inequality , disparities in healthcare provision, and poor gender equality .
Human semen in a petri dish .
Semen, also known as seminal fluid, is an organic fluid that may contain spermatozoa . It is secreted by the gonads (sexual glands) and other sexual organs of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize female ova .
In humans, seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa: proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa and provide a medium through which they can move or "swim".
Semen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle , which is located in the pelvis.
The process that results in the discharge of semen is called ejaculation .

In chemistry , an alkali (; from Arabic : al- qaly ‫ اﻟﻘﺎﻟﻲ‬,‫ ) اﻟﻘﻠﻲ‬is a basic , ionic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal element .
Some authors also define an alkali as a base that dissolves in water .
A solution of a soluble base has a pH greater than 7.
The adjective alkaline is commonly used in English as a synonym for base, especially for soluble bases.
This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the Arrhenius definition of a base and are still among the more common bases.
Francis Albert "Frank" Sinatra, , (December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer and film actor.
Beginning his musical career in the swing era with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey , Sinatra found unprecedented success as a solo artist from the early to mid-1940s after being signed to Columbia Records in 1943.
Being the idol of the " bobby soxers ", he released his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra in 1946.

Jameson is a single distillery Irish whiskey produced by a division of the French distiller Pernod Ricard .
Jameson is similar in its adherence to the single distillery principle to the single malt tradition, but Jameson blends column still spirit with Single pot still whiskey , a combination of malted barley with unmalted or "green" barley distilled in a pot still.
The company was established in 1780 when John Jameson established the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin .
Jameson was Scottish, a lawyer from Alloa who had married Margaret Haig, a sister of the brothers who founded the main Haig firms, and related to the Steins, a Scottish distilling family with interests in Dublin .
Portraits of John and Margaret Jameson by Sir Henry Raeburn are in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland .
Originally one of the six main Dublin Whiskeys, Jameson is now distilled in Cork , although vatting still takes place in Dublin .
With annual sales of over 31 million bottles, Jameson is by far the best selling Irish whiskey in the world, as it has been sold internationally since the early 19th century when John Jameson along with his son (also named John) was producing more than a million gallons annually.

New York City 2006First Michelin Red Guide for North America The Michelin Guide (French: Guide Michelin ) is a series of annual guide books published by Michelin for over a dozen countries.
The term normally refers to the Michelin Red Guide, the oldest and best-known European hotel and restaurant guide, which awards the Michelin stars.
Michelin also publishes Green Guides for travel and tourism, as well as several newer publications such as the Guide Voyageur Pratique (independent travel), Guide Gourmand (good-value eating- places), Guide Escapade (quick breaks) and Guide Coup de Cœur (favourite hotels).
First published in 1900 for France, Michelin introduced additional guides thereafter for other European countries.
In 2005, it published the first guide for the United States focusing on New York City; followed by its first Asian guide in 2007 for Tokyo.
In 2012, the Michelin Guide collection had 27 guide books covering 23 countries on three continents, with over 45,000 worldwide addresses.
Pink Guides have historically listed many more restaurants than rivals, relying on an extensive system of symbols to describe each establishment in as little as two lines.
Reviews of starred restaurants also include two to three culinary specialities.
Recently, however, short summaries (2– 3 lines) have been added to enhance descriptions of many establishments. These summaries are written in the language of the country for which the guide is published, but the symbols are the same throughout all editions.
Red Guides are also published for selected major cities: Paris , London , Tokyo , Kyoto / Osaka , Hokkaido , Hong Kong & Macau , New York City , the San Francisco Bay Area & Wine Country, Los Angeles , Chicago , and Las Vegas .
There is also a Red Guide encompassing the "Main Cities of Europe." In 2008, German restaurateur Juliane Caspar was appointed Editor-in-Chief of the French edition of the Red Guide.
She is the first woman and first non- French national to edit the French edition.
Sperm donation is the provision (or ‘donation’) by a man, (known as a ‘sperm donor’), of his sperm , with the intention that it be used to impregnate a woman who is not his sexual partner.
While the sperm donor is the natural or biological father of every child produced as a result of his donations, he is generally not intended to be the legal or de jure father.
Depending on the jurisdiction and its laws, he may or may not later be eligible to seek parental rights or be held responsible for parental obligations.
Sperm is often donated through sperm banks or clinics, which are subject to varying state regulations, including restrictions on donor anonymity and number of offspring.
By providing sperm privately and directly to the intended mother, donors and recipients may avoid legal restrictions but also lose the benefit of legal protections of the rights and responsibilities of both recipient and donor.
Heterosexual couples suffering from male infertility , lesbian couples, and single women are the primary recipients of donor sperm.
When going through a sperm bank, they may select their donor on the grounds of looks, personality, academic ability, race, and many other factors.
Some sperm banks, either by choice or regulation, limit the amount of information available to potential recipients; a desire to obtain more information on donors is one reason why recipients may choose to use a known donor and/or private donation.
Pregnancies are usually achieved using donated sperm by assisted reproductive technology , or ART. Techniques include artificial insemination (either by intracervical insemination (ISI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) in a clinic, or intravaginal insemination at home) and less commonly in vitro fertilization ( IVF ).
Insemination may also be achieved by a donor having sexual intercourse with a woman for the sole purpose of initiating conception.
This method is known as natural insemination, or NI . The general process of sperm donation is described as third party reproduction . 200px Gloria in excelsis Deo" ( Latin for "Glory to God in the highest") is a hymn known also as the Greater Doxology (as distinguished from the "Minor Doxology" or Gloria Patri ) and the Angelic Hymn. 1 Q462 what does gloria in excelsis deo mean D455 Gloria in Excelsis Deo D455-2 The name is often abbreviated to Gloria in Excelsis or simply Gloria. 0 Q462 what does gloria in excelsis deo mean D455 Gloria in Excelsis Deo D455-3 It is an example of the psalmi idiotici ("private psalms", i.e. compositions by individuals in imitation of the biblical Psalter ) that were popular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. 0 Q462 what does gloria in excelsis deo mean D455 Gloria in Excelsis Deo D455-4 Other surviving examples of this lyric poetry are the Te Deum and the Phos Hilaron . 0 Q463 how many grams in a troy ounce of gold D456 Troy weight D456-0 Troy ounce is a traditional unit of gold weight. 0 Q463 how many grams in a troy ounce of gold D456 Troy weight D456-1 Troy weight is a system of units of mass customarily used for precious metals and gemstones . 0 Q463 how many grams in a troy ounce of gold D456 Troy weight D456-2 There are 12 troy ounces per troy pound, rather than the 16 ounces per pound found in the more common avoirdupois system . 1 Q463 how many grams in a troy ounce of gold D456 Troy weight D456-3 The troy ounce is 480 grains, compared with the avoirdupois ounce, which is 4371⁄2 grains. 1 Q463 how many grams in a troy ounce of gold D456 Troy weight D456-4 Both systems use the same grain defined by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 as exactly 0.06479891 gram. 0 Q463 how many grams in a troy ounce of gold D456 Troy weight D456-5 Although troy ounces are still used to weigh gold , silver , and gemstones , the troy pound is no longer used in most other applications. 0 Q486 how is social system presented in descriptive research D479 Descriptive psychology D479-0 Descriptive psychology ("DP") is primarily a conceptual framework for the science of psychology . 0 Q486 how is social system presented in descriptive research D479 Descriptive psychology D479-1 Created in its original form by Peter G.

The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act is a federal statute that was signed into law by U.S.
President George W.
Bush on July 27, 2006.
The Walsh Act organizes sex offenders into three tiers and mandates that Tier 3 offenders (the most serious tier) update their whereabouts every three months with lifetime registration requirements.
Tier 2 offenders must update their whereabouts every six months with 25 years of registration, and Tier 1 offenders must update their whereabouts every year with 15 years of registration.
Failure to register and update information is a felony under the law.
The Act also creates a national sex offender registry and instructs each state and territory to apply identical criteria for posting offender data on the Internet (i.e., offender's name, address, date of birth, place of employment, photograph, etc.). The Act was named for Adam Walsh , an American boy who was abducted from a Florida shopping mall and later found murdered.
It also contains civil commitment provisions for sexually dangerous persons .  Sixth Army may refer to: In animal anatomy , the pinna ( Latin for feather ) is the visible part of the ear that resides outside of the head (this may also be referred to as the auricle or auricula).
In botany , it can refer to the segments of the leg a pinnate frond blade and is discussed in that section.
Margot Betti Frank (16 February 1926 – 9 March 1945) was the eldest daughter of Otto and Edith Frank, and the older sister of Anne Frank , whose deportation order from the Gestapo hastened the Frank family into hiding, and who subsequently perished in Bergen-Belsen .
According to the diary of her younger sister Anne, Margot was keeping a diary as well, but no trace of Margot's diary has ever been found.
Plasma (from Greek πλάσμα, "anything formed") is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid , liquid , and gas ).
Heating a gas may ionize its molecules or atoms (reducing or increasing the number of electrons in them), thus turning it into a plasma, which contains charged particles: positive ions and negative electrons or ions.
Ionization can be induced by other means, such as strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator, and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds , if present.
The presence of a non-negligible number of charge carriers makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields .
Plasma, therefore, has properties quite unlike those of solids , liquids , or gases and is considered a distinct state of matter .
Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container; unlike gas, under the influence of a magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double layers .
Some common plasmas are found in stars and neon signs .
In the universe , plasma is the most common state of matter for ordinary matter , most of which is in the rarefied intergalactic plasma (particularly intracluster medium ) and in stars.
Much of the understanding of plasmas has come from the pursuit of controlled nuclear fusion and fusion power , for which plasma physics provides the scientific basis.
The Circuit Courts of Maryland are the state trial courts of general jurisdiction in Maryland.
They are Maryland's highest courts of record exercising original jurisdiction at law and in equity in all civil and criminal matters, and have such additional powers and jurisdiction as conferred by the Maryland Constitution or by law.
The Circuit Courts also preside over divorce and most family law matters.
Probate and estate matters are handled by a separate Orphans' Court .
The Circuit Courts are the only Maryland state courts empowered to conduct jury trials .
Station identification (ident or channel ID) is the practice of radio or television stations or networks identifying themselves on air, typically by means of a call sign or brand name (sometimes known, particularly in the United States, as a "sounder" or "stinger", more generally as a station or network ID). This may be to satisfy requirements of licensing authorities, a form of branding or a combination of both. As such it is closely related to production logos used in television and cinema, alike.
Station identification used to be done regularly by an announcer at the halfway point during the presentation of a television program, or in between programs.
A leap year (or intercalary or bissextile year) is a year containing one additional day (or, in the case of lunisolar calendars , a month) in order to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year .
Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a whole number of days, a calendar that had the same number of days in each year would, over time, drift with respect to the event it was supposed to track.
By occasionally inserting (or intercalating ) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected.
A year that is not a leap year is called a common year .
For example, in the Gregorian calendar (a common solar calendar), February in a leap year has 29 days instead of the usual 28, so the year lasts 366 days instead of the usual 365.
Similarly, in the Hebrew calendar (a lunisolar calendar), Adar Aleph , a 13th lunar month is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons.
The term leap year gets its name from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, in a leap year the day of the week will advance two days (from March onwards) due to the year's extra day inserted at the end of February (thus "leaping over" one of the days in the week).
For example, Christmas Day fell on Saturday in 2004, Sunday in 2005, Monday in 2006 and Tuesday in 2007 but then "leapt" over Wednesday to fall on a Thursday in 2008.
Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist, the founder of the Ford Motor Company , and sponsor of the development of the assembly line technique of mass production .
Although Ford did not invent the automobile, he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle class Americans could afford to buy.
His introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized transportation and American industry.
As owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best- known people in the world.
He is credited with " Fordism ": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers.
Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace.
His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents.
Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation but arranged for his family to control the company permanently.
Ford was also widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I , but also for being the publisher of antisemitic texts such as the book The International Jew .
Bethlehem is a city in Lehigh and Northampton Counties in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania , in the United States.
As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 74,982, making it the seventh largest city in Pennsylvania, after Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Allentown , Erie , Reading , and Scranton . Bethlehem lies in the center of the Lehigh Valley, a region of 731 square miles (1,893 km2) that is home to more than 800,000 people.
The Valley embraces a trio of cities (Bethlehem, Allentown and Easton ) within two counties (Lehigh and Northampton), making it Pennsylvania's third-largest metropolitan area .
Smaller than Allentown but larger than Easton, Bethlehem is the Lehigh Valley's second most populous city.
There are three general sections of the city: North Bethlehem, South Bethlehem and West Bethlehem.
Each of these sections blossomed at different times in the city's development and each contains areas recognized under the National Register of Historic Places .
Zip codes that use the address Bethlehem totaled 116,000 in population in the year 2000.
These zip codes include Bethlehem Township .
In July 2006, Money magazine placed Bethlehem as number 88 on its "Top 100 Best Places to Live." Greater Tokyo Area , the world's most populous urban area, with about 35 million people.
Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006.
In 1800, 3% of the world's population lived in cities, a figure that had risen to 47% by the end of the twentieth century.
World map showing percent of population living in an urban environment.
An urban area is characterized by higher population density and vast human features in comparison to areas surrounding it.
Urban areas may be cities , towns or conurbations , but the term is not commonly extended to rural settlements such as villages and hamlets .
Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization .
Measuring the extent of an urban area helps in analyzing population density and urban sprawl , and in determining urban and rural populations.
Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting , with the urban core city being the primary labor market.
In the US, Metropolitan areas tend to be defined using counties or county sized political units as building blocks of much larger, albeit more condensed population units.
Counties tend to be stable political boundaries; economists prefer to work with economic and social statistics based on metropolitan areas.
Urbanized areas are a more relevant statistic for determining per capita land usage and densities.
Knossos (alternative spellings Knossus, Cnossus, Greek Κνωσός, is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and considered as Europe's oldest city.
The name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete.
The identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by tradition and by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named Kephala Hill, elevation from current sea level.
Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse, both symbols deriving from the myth of King Minos , supposed to have reigned from Knossos.
The coins came from the Roman settlement of Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus, a Roman colony placed just to the north of, and politically including, Kephala.
The Romans believed they had colonized Knossos. After excavation, the discovery of the Linear B tablets, and the decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris , the identification was confirmed by the reference to an administrative center, ko-no-so, Mycenaean Greek Knosos, undoubtedly the palace complex.
The palace was built over a Neolithic town.
During the Bronze Age, the town surrounded the hill on which the palace was built.
The palace was excavated and partially restored under the direction of Arthur Evans in the earliest years of the 20th century.
Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed Linear A and Linear B , to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present.
From the layering of the palace Evans developed de novo an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.
The palace of Knossos was undoubtedly the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture.
It appears as a maze of workrooms, living spaces, and storerooms close to a central square.
An approximate graphic view of some aspects of Cretan life in the Bronze Age is provided by restorations of the palace's indoor and outdoor murals , as it is also by the decorative motifs of the pottery and the insignia on the seals and sealings.
The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age, ca. 1380–1100 BC. The occasion is not known for certain, but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward.
The abandoning population were probably Mycenaean Greeks, who had earlier occupied the city-state, and were using Linear B as its administrative script, as opposed to Linear A, the previous administrative script.
The hill was never again a settlement or civic site, although squatters may have used it for a time.
Except for periods of abandonment, other cities were founded in the immediate vicinity, such as the Roman colony, and a Hellenistic Greek precedent.
The population shifted to the new town of Chandax (modern Heraklion ) during the 9th century AD. By the 13th century, it was called Makruteikhos 'Long Wall'; the bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves Bishops of Knossos until the 19th century.
Today, the name is used only for the archaeological site now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion.

The company also went nationwide with roaming agreements on March 23, 2010.
In August 2010, Leap Wireless and Sprint Nextel announced a five year agreement that allows Cricket Wireless to offer nationwide 3G service to its customers using Sprint's 3G network.
In May 2012, Cricket became the first wireless provider to begin carrying the Apple Inc. iPhone available off-contract.
Payment card numbers are found on payment cards , such as credit cards and debit cards , as well as stored-value cards , gift cards and other similar cards. Some card issuers refers to the card number as the primary account number or PAN. They have a certain level of internal structure and share a common numbering scheme .
Bank card numbers are allocated in accordance with ISO/IEC 7812 .
The bank card number merely identifies the card, which is then electronically associated by the issuing organisation with one of its customers and then to the customer's designated bank account /s.
In the case of stored-value type cards, there is no necessary association with a particular customer.
An ISO/IEC 7812 card number is typically 16 digits in length, and consists of: A drug test is a technical analysis of a biological specimen – for example urine, hair, blood, sweat, or oral fluid / saliva – to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their metabolites .
Major uses of drug testing are to detect the presence of performance enhancing steroids in sport or for drugs prohibited by laws, such as cannabis , cocaine and heroin.
A "10-panel urine screen" consists of the following: Amphetamines (including Methamphetamine ) Barbiturates Benzodiazepines Cannabinoids ( THC ) Cocaine Methadone Methaqualone Opiates ( Codeine , Morphine , Heroin , Oxycodone , Hydrocodone , etc.) Phencyclidine ( PCP ) Propoxyphene The Connecticut Huskies, also known as the UConn Huskies, are the athletic teams of the University of Connecticut in the United States.
The school is a member of National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I and the Big East Conference (which becomes the American Athletic Conference in July, 2013) for all sports except men's ice hockey ( Atlantic Hockey ) and women's ice hockey ( Hockey East ).
The major sports at the university are football (played at Rentschler Field ) and men's and women's basketball (played on-campus at Harry A.
Gampel Pavilion and off-campus at the XL Center ), although many of the other sports have large followings and a tradition of success.
UConn is one of only 15 universities in the nation that plays Division I FBS football and Division I men's ice hockey.
The great white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, also known as the great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large lamniform shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.
The great white shark is mainly known for its size, with the largest individuals known to have approached or exceeded in length, and in weight.
This shark reaches its maturity around 15 years of age and can have a life span of over 30 years.
The great white shark is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals .
It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds .
It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon , and is ranked first in having the most attacks on humans.
The IUCN list the great white shark as a vulnerable species , while it is included in Appendix II of CITES . The bestselling novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the subsequent blockbuster film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great white shark as a "ferocious man eater ". In reality, humans are not the preferred prey of the great white shark.
This is a list of present and extant dukes in the peerages of the Kingdom of England , Kingdom of Scotland , Kingdom of Great Britain , Kingdom of Ireland , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 1927 and after.

John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK, was the 35th President of the United States , serving from 1961 until his death in 1963.
After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific , Kennedy represented Massachusetts' 11th congressional district in the U.S.
House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat .
Thereafter, he served in the U.S.
Senate from 1953 until 1960.
Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election .
At 43 years of age, he is the youngest to have been elected to the office, the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt ), and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president.
A Catholic , Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president, and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize .
Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the building of the Berlin Wall , the Space Race , the African- American Civil Rights Movement , and early stages of the Vietnam War .
Therein, Kennedy increased the number of military advisers, special operation forces, and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia.
The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government.
It involved certain forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents.
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas , Texas.
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later, before a trial could take place.
The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin.
However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy .
However, ABC News in their investigation, The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy, confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission; having concluded Oswald acted alone.
Kennedy's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970.
Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light.
Details of Kennedy's health problems in which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s.
Although initially kept secret from the general public, reports of Kennedy's philandering have garnered much press.
Kennedy ranks highly in public opinion ratings of U.S. presidents . The United States House of Representatives is one of the two houses of the United States Congress (a bicameral legislature ).
It is frequently referred to as the House.
The other house is the Senate .
The composition and powers of the House are established in Article One of the United States Constitution .
The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire country although its bills must also be passed by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S.
President before becoming law (unless both the House and Senate re-pass the legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber).
The House has several exclusive powers: the power to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials, and to elect the U.S.
President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College .
Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population but is entitled to at least one representative .
The most populous state, California , currently has 53 representatives.
The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435.
Each representative serves for a two- year term.
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , who presides over the chamber, is elected by the members of the House, and is therefore traditionally the leader of the House Democratic Caucus or the House Republican Conference , whichever party has more voting members.
The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol .
This pentacle , worn as a pendant , depicts a pentagram , or five-pointed star, used as a symbol of Wicca by many adherents.
Wicca () is a modern pagan , witchcraft religion .
It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and it was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner , a retired British civil servant.
It draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practice.
Wicca is a diverse religion with no central authority or figure defining it.
It is divided into various lineages and denominations , referred to as "traditions", each with its own organisational structure and level of centralisation .
Due to its decentralized nature, there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes Wicca.
Some traditions, collectively referred to as British Traditional Wicca , strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term "Wicca" to apply only to such lineaged traditions, while other eclectic traditions do not.
Wicca is typically duotheistic , worshipping a god and goddess traditionally viewed as a mother goddess and horned god .
These two deities are often viewed as facets of a greater pantheistic godhead .
However, beliefs range from "hard" polytheism to even monotheism .
Wiccan celebration follows approximately eight seasonally based festivals known as Sabbats .
An unattributed statement known as the Wiccan Rede is the traditional basis of Wiccan morality.
Wicca involves the ritual practice of magic .

Flagg 's 1917 poster, based on the original British Lord Kitchener poster of three years earlier, was used to recruit soldiers for both World War I and World War II . Flagg used a modified version of his own face for Uncle Sam, and veteran Walter Botts provided the pose. Uncle Sam (initials U.S.) is a common national personification of the American government that, according to legend, came into use during the War of 1812 and was supposedly named for Samuel Wilson .
The first use of Uncle Sam in literature was in the 1816 allegorical book "The Adventures of Uncle Sam in Search After His Lost Honor" by Frederick Augustus Fidfaddy, Esq.
An Uncle Sam is mentioned as early as 1775, in the original " Yankee Doodle " lyrics of the Revolutionary War.
It is not clear whether this reference is to Uncle Sam as a metaphor for the United States.
The lyrics as a whole clearly deride the military efforts of the young nation, besieging the British at Boston.
The 13th stanza is: Old Uncle Sam come there to change Some pancakes and some onions, For ’lasses cakes, to carry home To give his wife and young ones.
Karma ( Sanskrit , also karman, Pāli : Kamma) means "action" or "doing"; whatever one does, says, or thinks is a karma.
In Buddhism , the term karma is used specifically for those actions which spring from the intention (Sanskrit: cetanā , Pali: cetana) of an unenlightened being.
These bring about a fruit (Sanskrit, Pali: phala) or result (S., P. vipāka ; the two are often used together as vipākaphala), either within the present life, or in the context of a future rebirth.
Other Indian religions have different views on karma .
Karma is the engine which drives the wheel of the cycle of uncontrolled rebirth (S., P. ' ) for each being.
In the early texts it is not, however, the only causal mechanism influencing the lives of sentient beings.
As one scholar states, "the Buddhist theory of action and result (karmaphala) is fundamental to much of Buddhist doctrine, because it provides a coherent model of the functioning of the world and its beings, which in turn forms the doctrinal basis for the Buddhist explanations of the path of liberation from the world and its result, nirvāṇa ." A typical medical syringe with needle A syringe is a simple pump consisting of a plunger that fits tightly in a tube.
The plunger can be pulled and pushed along inside a cylindrical tube (called a barrel), allowing the syringe to take in and expel a liquid or gas through an at the open end of the tube.
The open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle , a nozzle , or tubing to help direct the flow into and out of the barrel.
Syringes are often used to administer injections , insert intravenous drugs into the bloodstream, apply compounds such as glue or lubricant , and measure liquids.
The word "syringe" is derived from the Greek συριγξ syrinx = "tube" via back- formation of a new singular from its Greek-type plural "syringes" (συριγγες syringes).
Maximum life span refers to a measure of the maximum amount of time one or more members of a population has been observed to survive between birth and death .
The term can also denote an estimate of the maximum amount of time that a member of a given species could survive between life and death, provided circumstances that are optimal to their longevity.
Most living species have at least one upper limit on the number of times cells can divide.
For humans, this is called the Hayflick limit , although number of cell divisions does not strictly control lifespan (non- dividing cells and dividing cells lived over 120 years in the oldest known human ). David Carradine (born John Arthur Carradine; December 8, 1936 – June 3, 2009) was an American actor and martial artist, best known for his leading role as a warrior monk , Kwai Chang Caine , in the 1970s television series Kung Fu .
He was a member of a productive acting family that began with his father, John Carradine .
His acting career, which included major and minor roles on stage, television and cinema, spanned over four decades.
A prolific "B" movie actor, he appeared in more than 100 feature films and was nominated four times for a Golden Globe Award .
The last nomination was for his title role in Quentin Tarantino 's Kill Bill .
Films that featured Carradine continued to be released after his death.
These posthumous credits were from a variety of genres including horror, action, western, martial arts, drama, science fiction and documentary.
In addition to his acting career, Carradine was also a musician and pursued a directing career.
Influenced by his most popular acting role, he studied martial arts .
The son of a frequently married actor, he had an unstable childhood.
This instability would continue throughout his life as he himself was married five times.
He was also frequently arrested and prosecuted for a variety of offenses which often involved substance abuse.
He died on June 3, 2009, apparently of auto-erotic asphyxiation .
Bowel obstruction (or intestinal obstruction) is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines, preventing the normal transit of the products of digestion.
It can occur at any level distal to the duodenum of the small intestine and is a medical emergency .
The condition is often treated conservatively over a period of 2–5 days with the patient's progress regularly monitored by an assigned physician.
Surgical procedures are performed on occasion however in life-threatening cases, such as when the root cause is a fully lodged foreign object or malignant tumor .
Education in the United States is mainly provided by the public sector , with control and funding coming from three levels: local , state , and federal , in that order.
Child education is compulsory , and there are also a large number and wide variety of higher education institutions throughout the country that one can choose to attend, both publicly and privately administered.
Public education is universally available.
School curricula, funding, teaching, employment, and other policies are set through locally elected school boards with jurisdiction over school districts with many directives from state legislatures.
School districts are usually separate from other local jurisdictions, with independent officials and budgets.
Educational standards and standardized testing decisions are usually made by state governments.
The ages for compulsory education vary by state.
It begins from ages five to eight and ends from ages fourteen to eighteen.
Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by educating children in public schools , state-certified private schools , or an approved home school program.
In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: elementary school , middle school (sometimes called junior high school), and high school (sometimes referred to as secondary education). In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into grades , ranging from kindergarten (followed by first grade ) for the youngest children in elementary school, up to twelfth grade , the final year of high school .
The exact age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to area.
Post-secondary education , better known as " college " in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system, and is described in a separate section below.
Government supported, free public schools for all started being established after the revolution, and expanded in the 19th century, as the results of efforts of men like Horace Mann and Booker T.
Washington .
By 1870, all states had free elementary schools, albeit only in urban centers.
As the 20th century drew nearer, states started passing laws to make schooling compulsory, and by 1910, 72 percent of children attended school.
Private schools continued to spread during this time, as well as colleges and —in the rural centers— land grant colleges .
The year of 1910 also saw the first true high schools.
During the rest of the 20th century, educational efforts centered on reducing the inequality of the schooling system.
The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v.
Board of Education made the desegregation of elementary and high schools a national priority, while the Pell Grant program helped poor minorities gain access to college.
Special education was made into federal law in 1975.
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 made standardized testing a requirement, and in 1983, a commission was established to evaluate their results and propose a course of action.
The resulting No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was controversial and its goals proved to be unrealistic.
A commission established in 2006 evaluated higher education , but its recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.
Squirrels belong to a large family of small or medium-sized rodents called the Sciuridae.
The family includes tree squirrels , ground squirrels , chipmunks , marmots (including woodchucks ), flying squirrels , and prairie dogs .
Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and have been introduced to Australia .
The earliest known squirrels date from the Eocene and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among living rodent families.
Keith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English musician, singer- songwriter and founder member of the English rock band the Rolling Stones .
Rolling Stone magazine said Richards had created "rock's greatest single body of riffs", ranking him 4th on its list of 100 best guitarists.
Fourteen songs Richards wrote with the Rolling Stones' lead vocalist Mick Jagger are listed among Rolling Stone magazine's " 500 Greatest Songs of All Time ".
Richards' notoriety for illicit drug use stems in part from several drug busts during the late 1960s and 1970s and his candour regarding his addiction to and eventual abstinence from heroin.
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives (or Speaker of the House) is the presiding officer of the chamber.
The office was established in 1789 by Article I , Section 2 of the United States Constitution , which states in part, "The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker..." The current Speaker is John Boehner , a Republican who represents Ohio's 8th congressional district . The Constitution does not require that the Speaker be a Member of Congress, but no non-member has ever been elected to the office.
The Speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession , after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro tempore of the U.S.
Senate .
Unlike some Westminster system parliaments, in which the office of Speaker is considered non-partisan, in the United States the Speaker of the House is a leadership position and the office-holder actively works to set the majority party's legislative agenda.
The Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates, instead delegating the duty to members of the House from the majority party.
Aside from duties relating to heading the House and the majority political party, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions, and represents his or her Congressional district.
The Gulf War (2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Storm (17 January 1991 – 28 February 1991) was a war waged by a U.N.-authorized Coalition force from 34 nations led by the United States , against Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait .
The war is also known under other names , such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, or the First Iraq War, before the term "Iraq War" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also referred to in the U.S. as "Operation Iraqi Freedom").
Kuwait's invasion by Iraqi troops that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N.
Security Council .
U.S.
President George H.
W.
Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene.
An array of nations joined the Coalition.
The great majority of the Coalition's military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order.
Saudi Arabia paid around US$36 billion of the US$60 billion cost.
The war was marked by the beginning of live news on the front lines of the fight, with the primacy of the U.S. network CNN . The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast images on board the U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm.
The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial bombardment on 17 January 1991.
This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February.
This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory.
The Coalition ceased their advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started.
Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia's border.
Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel .
A diplexer is a passive device that implements frequency domain multiplexing .
Two ports (e.g., L and H) are multiplexed onto a third port (e.g., S). The signals on ports L and H occupy disjoint frequency bands.
Consequently, the signals on L and H can coexist on port S without interfering with each other.
Typically, the signal on port L will occupy a single low frequency band and the signal on port H will occupy a higher frequency band. In that situation, the diplexer consists of a lowpass filter connecting ports L and S and high pass filter connecting ports H and S.
Ideally, all the signal power on port L is transferred to the S port and vice versa.
All the signal power on port H is transferred to port S and vice versa.
Ideally, the separation of the signals is complete.
None of the low band signal is transferred from the S port to the H port.
In the real world, some power will be lost, and some signal power will leak to the wrong port.
Television diplexer consisting of a high- pass filter (left) and a low-pass filter (right).
The antenna is connected to the screw terminals to the left of center.
The diplexer, being a passive device, is reciprocal: the device itself doesn't have a notion of input or output.
The diplexer is a different device than a passive combiner or splitter.
The ports of a diplexer are frequency selective; the ports of a combiner are not.
There is also a power "loss" difference - a combiner takes all the power delivered to the S port and equally divides it between the A and B ports.
A diplexer does not.
A diplexer multiplexes two ports onto one port, but more than two ports may be multiplexed: a three-port to one-port multiplexer is known as a triplexer.
The American frontier comprises the geography, history, folklore, and cultural expression of life in the forward wave of American westward expansion that began with English colonial settlements in the early 17th century and ended with the assimilation of the last mainland territories into states in the early 20th century .
Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the western United States in the second half of the nineteenth century, a period sometimes called the Old West, or the Wild West.
As defined by Hine and Faragher, "frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states." They explain, "It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America." Through treaties with foreign nations and native tribes, political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, building farms, ranches and towns, marking trails and digging mines, and pulling in great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast fulfilling the dreams of Manifest destiny .
Historian Frederick Jackson Turner in his " Frontier thesis " (1893) theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as individualism, self- reliance and violence.
As the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the West in fiction and film took firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike.
America is exceptional in choosing its iconic self-image.
No other nation," says David Murdoch, "has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America’s creation of the West.  The Asus Eee PC is a netbook computer line from ASUSTeK Computer Incorporated , and a part of the Asus Eee product family.
At the time of its introduction in late 2007, it was noted for its combination of a light weight, Linux -based operating system , solid-state drive (SSD), and relatively low cost. Newer models added the options of Microsoft Windows operating system, rotating media hard disk drives (HDD) and initially retailed for up to 500 euros .
The first Eee PC was a milestone in the personal computer business, launching the netbook category of small, low cost laptops in the West (in Japan, subnotebooks had long been a staple in computing).
According to Asus, the name Eee derives from "the three Es", an abbreviation of its advertising slogan for the device: "Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play".
In January 2013, Asus officially ended production of their Eee PC series due to declining sales as a result of consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks.

The polar jet stream can travel at speeds greater than .
Here, the fastest winds are colored red; slower winds are blue.
Clouds along a jet stream over Canada.
Jet streams flow from west to east in the upper portion of the troposphere.
Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmospheres of some planets , including Earth .
The main jet streams are located near the tropopause , the transition between the troposphere (where temperature decreases with altitude ) and the stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude).
The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds (flowing west to east).
Their paths typically have a meandering shape; jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet.
The strongest jet streams are the polar jets, at around above sea level, and the higher and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at around .
The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet.
The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America , Europe , and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.
Jet streams are caused by a combination of a planet's rotation on its axis and atmospheric heating (by solar radiation and, on some planets other than Earth, internal heat ).
Jet streams form near boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in temperature , such as the polar region and the warmer air towards the equator.
Other jet streams also exist.
During the northern hemisphere summer, easterly jets can form in tropical regions, typically in a region where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes.
Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States.
Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting .
The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against the flow of a jet stream.
Clear-air turbulence , a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity but does not create a substantial alteration on flight times.
The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America . The first three Articles of the Constitution establish the rules and separate powers of the three branches of the federal government: a legislature, the bicameral Congress ; an executive branch led by the President ; and a federal judiciary headed by the Supreme Court .
The last four Articles frame the principle of federalism .
The Tenth Amendment confirms its federal characteristics .
The Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and ratified by conventions in eleven states .
It went into effect on March 4, 1789.
The United States Constitution can be changed through the amendment process.
Constitutional amendments are added to it, altering its effect.
The first ten amendments, ratified by three-fourths of the states in 1791, are known as the Bill of Rights .
The Constitution has been amended seventeen additional times (for a total of twenty-seven amendments).
Principles of the Constitution, as amended, are applied in courts of law by judicial review .
The Constitution guides American law and political culture .
Its writers composed the first constitution of its kind incorporating recent developments in constitutional theory with multiple traditions, and their work influenced later writers of national constitutions .
It is supplemented and interpreted by a large body of United States constitutional law .
Recent impulses for reform center on concerns for extending democracy and balancing the federal budget .

Islam has been present in the United Kingdom since its formation in 1707, though it was not legally recognised until the Trinitarian Act in 1812.
Today it is the second largest religion in the country with results from the United Kingdom Census 2011 suggesting that by 2011 the total Muslim population had reached 2.7 million, 4.8% of the total population.
The vast majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom live in England and Wales : of 1,591,000 Muslims recorded at the 2001 Census, 1,536,015 were living in England and Wales , where they formed 3% of the population in 2001; 42,557 were living in Scotland , forming 0.84% of the population; and 1,943 were living in Northern Ireland .
In 2011, it was reported that United Kingdom has around 100,000 converts to Islam (gaining 40,000 since 2001) with 66% of them being women.
The number of conversions seems to be increasing, in 2011 alone there were 5,200 converts for that year.
Between 2001 and 2009, the Muslim population increased roughly 10 times faster than the rest of society.
Interstate 75 (I-75) is a part of the Interstate Highway System and runs from Hialeah, Florida , a few miles northwest of Miami to Sault Ste.
Marie in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan .
I-75 begins its national northward journey in Hialeah, running along the western parts of South Florida before traveling westward across Alligator Alley , resuming its northward direction in Naples , running along Florida's Gulf Coast, passing the cities of Ft. Myers , Port Charlotte , and the Tampa Bay Area , before turning inward towards Ocala , Gainsville and Lake City before leaving the state and entering Georgia.
I-75 runs for in Florida, making it the longest interstate in any state east of the Mississippi River. The interstate maintains a speed limit of for its entire length in Florida.
The portion of I-75 from Tampa northward was a part of the original 1955 Interstate Highway plans, with I-75's southern terminus at I-4's current western terminus.
The interstate was extended south to Miami was established in 1968 after massive growth in Southwest Florida, which resulted in I-75 being realigned to travel on the eastern fringes of the Tampa Bay area, and the last portions of the highway was opened in 1993.
For FDOT inventory purposes, it is designated as SR 93 for most of its length in Florida (with exception to the Tampa Bay area, where SR 93 follows I- 275, while SR 93A travels with I-75 in the latter's bypass of the area).
American football, known in the United States as football, is a team sport .
It is played by two teams, eleven players to a side, who advance an oval ball over a rectangular field that is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide and has goalposts at both ends.
The team in possession of the ball (the offense) attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball.
To continue their drive, the offense must advance the ball at least 10 yards down the field in a series of four downs .
If they succeed, they receive a new set of four downs to continue their drive.
Otherwise, they lose control of the ball to the opposing team.
The offense can score points by advancing the ball into the end zone (a touchdown ) or by kicking the ball through the opponent's goalpost (a field goal ), while the defense can score points by forcing an offensive turnover and advancing the ball into the offense's end zone or by tackling the ballcarrier in the offense's end zone (a safety ).
The team that has scored the most points by the end of the game wins.
American football evolved from early forms of rugby , particularly rugby union , and association football (soccer).
The first game was played on November 6, 1869 under a set of rules resembling those of rugby and soccer.
A set of rule changes instituted from 1880 onward by Walter Camp established the snap , eleven-player teams and downs .
Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the width of the football.
American football is the most popular sport in the United States today, and the National Football League (NFL) is its most popular league.
The league's championship, the Super Bowl , is among the most-watched club sporting events in the world.

The Battle of Iwo Jima (19 February – 26 March 1945), or Operation Detachment, was a major battle in which the United States Armed Forces fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire .
The American invasion had the goal of capturing the entire island, including its three airfields , to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands.
This month-long battle included some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the War in the Pacific of World War II. The Imperial Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified , with a dense network of bunkers , hidden artillery positions, and of underground tunnels.
The Americans on the ground were aided by extensive naval artillery and the U.S.
Navy and Marine Corps aviators had complete air supremacy over Iwo Jima from the beginning of the battle.
American seapower and airpower were capable of delivering vast amounts of fire onto the Japanese troops.
This invasion was the first American attack on Japanese home territory , and the Japanese soldiers and marines defended their positions tenaciously with no thought of surrender.
The Japanese general in charge never considered surrendering to the Americans to save his men, and he and his officers had vowed to fight to the death, no matter how hopeless their battle was.
Iwo Jima was also the only battle by the U.S.
Marine Corps in which the overall American casualties (killed and wounded) exceeded those of the Japanese, although Japanese combat deaths were thrice those of the Americans throughout the battle.
Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner.
Some of them were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled.
The rest were killed or missing and presumed dead.
Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides, the Japanese defeat was assured from the start.
The Americans possessed an overwhelming superiority in arms and numbers.
These factors, coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, ensured that there were no plausible circumstances in which the Americans could have lost the battle.
The battle was immortalized by Joe Rosenthal 's photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag on top of the Mount Suribachi by five U.S.
Marines and one U.S.
Navy battlefield Hospital Corpsman .
The photograph records the second flag- raising on the mountain, both of which took place on the fifth day of the 35-day battle.
The picture became the iconic image of the battle and it has been widely reproduced.

Commissioner David Axelrod (not to be confused with presidential advisor David Axelrod ) stated that Love Canal would long be remembered as a ""national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations." The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants "overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around." The Great Sphinx and the pyramids of Giza are among the most recognizable symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt.
Ancient Egypt was an ancient civilization of Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt .
Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh .
The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age .
Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period where it rivalled the Hittite Empire , Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire , after which it entered a period of slow decline.
Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers (such as the Canaanites / Hyksos , Libyans , Nubians , Assyria , Babylonia , Persian rule and Macedonian Greece ) in the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt and Late Period .
In the aftermath of Alexander the Great 's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter , established himself as the new ruler of Egypt.
This Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty ruled Egypt until 30 BC, when, under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province .
The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River Valley.
The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which fueled social development and culture.
With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance.
Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a Pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs .
The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that facilitated the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty with Hittites .
Egypt left a lasting legacy.
Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travellers and writers for centuries.
A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.

This edition of Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the first to feature someone on the cover other than Tiger himself.
The privilege was given to the Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy , who was the first person to win a PGA Tour event before their 21st birthday since Tiger Woods.
This article is about the ballpark which opened in 2009.
For the original stadium, on the south side of 161st Street, go to Yankee Stadium (1923) .
Yankee Stadium is a stadium located in The Bronx in New York City.
It is the home ballpark for the New York Yankees , one of the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises.
It opened at the beginning of the 2009 MLB season as a replacement for the team's previous home, the original Yankee Stadium , which opened in 1923 and closed in 2008.
The new ballpark was constructed across the street, north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park .
The ballpark opened April 2, 2009, when the Yankees hosted a workout day in front of fans from the Bronx community.
The first game at the new Yankee Stadium was a pre-season exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs played on April 3, 2009, which the Yankees won 7–4.
The first regular season game was played on April 16, a 10–2 Yankee loss to the Cleveland Indians .
Much of the stadium incorporates design elements from the previous Yankee Stadium, thus paying homage to Yankee history.
Although stadium construction began in August 2006, the project of building a new stadium for the Yankees is one that spanned many years and faced many controversies.
The stadium was built on what had been of public parkland.
Replacement baseball fields opened in April 2012.
Also controversial was the price tag of $1.5 billion, which makes it not only the most expensive baseball stadium ever built, but the second-most expensive stadium of any kind (after MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey ).

Amaretto is a sweet, almond-flavoured , Italian liqueur .
It is made from a base of apricot pits or almonds, sometimes both.
PC power supply with several connectors.
From left to right: Molex Mini-fit Jr 20 and 4 pin, Molex KK, SATA connector, Molex 8981 and Molex mini-spox.
Molex connector is the vernacular term for a two-piece pin and socket interconnection, most frequently disk drive connectors.
Pioneered by Molex Connector Company, the two-piece design became an early electronic standard.
Molex developed and patented the first examples of this connector style in the late 1950s and early 1960s. First used in home appliances, other industries soon began designing it into their products from automobiles to vending machines to mini-computers.
In such a connector, cylindrical spring- metal pins fit into cylindrical spring-metal sockets.
The pins and sockets are held in a rectangular matrix in a nylon shell.
The connector typically has two to 24 contacts and is polarized or keyed to ensure correct orientation.
Pins and sockets can be arranged in any combination in a single housing, and each housing can be either male or female.
There are three typical pin sizes: , , and .
The 1.57 mm pin can carry 5 A of current, while the 2.36 mm can carry 8.5 A.
Because the pins have a large contact surface area and fit tightly, these connectors are typically used for power.
This style of connector was first used as a computer disk drive connector in the late 1970s, initially on the Shugart floppy disk drive as well as Atari (1979) on its path to becoming a de facto standard.
It is in this role that the vernacular term molex connector is most frequently used.
AMP (now a division of Tyco International ) developed the MATE-N- LOK 2.13 mm pin connector that is the same as the Molex 8981 power connector.
This Molex and Amp connector configuration was the established standard for disk drive power connectors until the introduction of SATA disk drives .
Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1986 American coming of age comedy film written and directed by John Hughes .
The film follows high school senior Ferris Bueller ( Matthew Broderick ), who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago .
Accompanied by his girlfriend Sloane Peterson ( Mia Sara ) and his best friend Cameron Frye ( Alan Ruck ), he creatively avoids his school's Dean of Students Edward Rooney ( Jeffrey Jones ), his resentful sister Jeanie ( Jennifer Grey ), and his parents.
During the film, Bueller frequently breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera to explain to the audience his techniques and thoughts.
Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week and shot the film—on a budget of $5.8 million—over several months in late 1985.
Featuring many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower and the Art Institute of Chicago , the film was Hughes' love letter to the city: "I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could.
Not just in the architecture and landscape, but the spirit." Released by Paramount Pictures on June 11, 1986, Ferris Bueller's Day Off became one of the top grossing films of the year and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences alike. Singles Awareness (or Appreciation) Day" (S.A.D.) is a humorous holiday , celebrated on February 14 (although some prefer the 13th or the 15th to get away from the commercialism associated with the 14th). 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-1 It serves as an alternative to Valentine's Day for people who are single, that is, not involved in a romantic relationship . 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-2 Some people who observe S.A.D. do so out of spite for Valentine's Day, as a Hallmark holiday , or for other reasons. 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-3 On Singles Awareness Day, single people gather to celebrate or to commiserate in their single status. 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-4 Some want to remind romantic couples that they don't need to be in a relationship to celebrate life . 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-5 Common activities during Singles Awareness Day include, single events, traveling , volunteering , treating oneself to popular activities, gathering of family and friends, and gift giving for oneself. 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-6 One increasingly popular activity is to travel to Brazil and witness the Brazilian Carnival , coupled with the fact that Brazil doesn't celebrate Valentine's Day on February 14, but in June. 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-7 Both factors provide a temporary getaway from the Valentine's holiday and substitute it with another celebration. 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-8 On this day many people wear green, as it is considered to be the 'opposite' of red. 0 Q889 how many single people on Valentine's Day D859 Singles Awareness Day D859-9 Another popular option is an absence of color (black), to symbolize an absence of celebration. 0 Q894 what football conference is temple in D864 Temple Owls D864-0 The Temple Owls are the athletic teams representing Temple University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . 0 Q894 what football conference is temple in D864 Temple Owls D864-1 The school's sports teams are called the Owls . 0 Q894 what football conference is temple in D864 Temple Owls D864-2 The current athletic director is Bill Bradshaw. 0 Q894 what football conference is temple in D864 Temple Owls D864-3 The owl has been the symbol and mascot for Temple University since its founding in the 1880s. 0 Q894 what football conference is temple in D864 Temple Owls D864-4 Temple was the first school in the United States to adopt the owl as its symbol or mascot. 0 Q894 what football conference is temple in D864 Temple Owls D864-5 The owl, a nocturnal hunter, was initially adopted as a symbol because Temple University began as a night school for young people of limited means. 0 Q894 what football conference is temple in D864 Temple Owls D864-6 Russell Conwell , Temple's founder, encouraged these students with the remark: "The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day. Samuel Ruben (born Charles Rubenstein, November 5, 1913 – September 28, 1943), the son of Herschel and Frieda Penn Rubenstein – the name was officially shortened to Ruben in 1930.
Young Sam developed a friendship with neighbor Jack Dempsey and became involved with a local boys' boxing club and later, when the family moved across the Bay to Berkeley , he was a successful basketball player at Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California) .
After achieving his B.S. in Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley , he continued his studies there and was awarded a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry in May 1938.
He was immediately appointed Instructor in the Chemistry Department, and became an Assistant Professor in 1941.
Sam and colleague Martin Kamen , a University of Chicago Ph.D. and researcher in chemistry and nuclear physics working under Ernest O.
Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory , set out to elucidate the path of carbon in photosynthesis by incorporating the short-lived radioactive isotope Carbon-11 (11CO2) in their many experiments between 1938 and 1942.
Aided by the concepts and collaboration of C.
B. van Niel , at Stanford University ’s Hopkins Marine Station , it became clear to them that reduction of CO2 can occur in the dark and may involve processes similar to bacterial systems.
This interpretation challenged the century-old Adolf von Baeyer theory of photochemical reduction of CO2 adsorbed on chlorophyll which had guided decades of effort by Richard Willstätter , A.
Stoll, and many others in vain searches for formaldehyde .
In hundreds of experiments with Carbon- 11 produced from deuterons and Boron- 10 by Martin Kamen in the Radiation Laboratory’s 37-inch cyclotron , Ruben and Kamen, with collaborators from botany , microbiology , physiology and organic chemistry , pursued the path of carbon dioxide in plants, algae, and bacteria.
Their results, confused by absorption of the products on proteinaceous residues, initially failed to reveal the path of carbon in photosynthesis but succeeded in exciting the interest of scientists worldwide in the search and revelation of metabolic processes, beginning a revolution in biochemistry and medicine.
Ruben’s experiments using 'heavy water', H2O18, to yield 18O2 gas had shown that the oxygen gas produced in photosynthesis comes from water.
With nuclear physicists' tenuous prediction of a "long lived radioactive carbon isotope,” Ruben and Kamen pursued several routes that could lead to identification of the Carbon-14 isotope.
After several failed attempts, Martin Kamen collected the results of a 120- hour cyclotron bombardment of graphite and trudged in the rain with it to the “Rat House,” adjacent both to the Chemistry Department and to the cyclotron , and Sam Ruben's desk.
At 8 AM, February 27, 1940, Sam Ruben demonstrated unequivocally the radioactivity was from Carbon-14 .
The weak energy of Carbon-14 made measurement tedious.
So tedious that no tracer experiments with C-14 were done until 1942 when Sam Ruben gave all his barium carbonate-C14 to young Chemistry Department faculty member Andrew Benson who began his long series of 14CO2 fixation experiments to determine the path of carbon in photosynthesis .
Only in 1949 did chemist Willard Libby use it to invent radiocarbon dating .
Ruben's recruitment for research in the World War II wartime effort led him to interest in the mechanism of phosgene as a poisonous gas. With C-11 phosgene (11COCl2) prepared by Benson, they studied the combination of phosgene with lung proteins.
Following Benson's departure from Berkeley in July 1943, Ruben died September 28, 1943 after a disastrous exposure to phosgene in a laboratory accident the preceding day.
Sam Ruben married Helena Collins West, a fellow chemistry student, during his final semester as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, on September 28, 1935.
They had three children, Dana West Ruben (born November 11, 1938), George Collins Ruben (born April 29, 1941, and Connie Mae Ruben Fatt (born June 18, 1943).
The Starving Time at Jamestown in the Colony of Virginia was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609– 1610 in which all but 60 of 500 colonists died.
The colonists, the first group of whom had originally arrived at Jamestown on May 14, 1607, had never planned to grow all of their own food.
Their plans depended upon trade with the local Native Americans' Powhatan Confederacy to supply them with food between the arrivals of periodic supply ships from England.
Lack of access to water and a relatively dry rain season crippled the agricultural production of the colonists.
Also, the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year.
A fleet from England, damaged by a hurricane, arrived months behind schedule with new colonists, but without expected food supplies.
On June 7, 1610 the survivors boarded ships, abandoned the colony site, and sailed towards the Chesapeake Bay , where another supply convoy with new supplies and headed by a newly appointed governor, Thomas West, Baron De La Warr , intercepted them on the lower James River and returned them to Jamestown.
Within a few years, the commercialization of tobacco by John Rolfe secured the settlement's long-term economic prosperity.
There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time.
Culture (, lit.
Colonists who supported the British in opposing the Revolution are usually referred to as " Loyalists " or "Tories." The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as "America".
John Trumbull 's Declaration of Independence , showing the five-man committee in charge of drafting the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 as it presents its work to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia The American Revolution was a political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which thirteen colonies in North America joined together to break from the British Empire , combining to become the United States of America .
They first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials.
By 1774 each colony had established a Provincial Congress or an equivalent governmental institution to govern itself, but still recognized the British Crown and their inclusion in the empire.
The British responded by sending combat troops to re-impose direct rule.
Through the Second Continental Congress , the Americans then managed the armed conflict in response to the British known as the American Revolutionary War (also: American War of Independence, 1775–83).
The British sent invasion armies and used their powerful navy to blockade the coast. George Washington became the American commander, working with Congress and the states to raise armies and neutralize the influence of Loyalists.
Claiming the rule of George III of Great Britain was tyrannical and therefore illegitimate , Congress declared independence as a new nation in July 1776, when Thomas Jefferson wrote and the states unanimously ratified the United States Declaration of Independence .
The British lost Boston in 1776, but then captured and held New York City.
The British would capture the revolutionary capital at Philadelphia in 1777, but Congress escaped, and the British withdrew a few months later.
After a British army was captured by the American army at Saratoga , the French balanced naval power by entering the war in 1778 as allies of the United States.
A combined American-French force captured a second British army at Yorktown in 1781, effectively ending the war.
A peace treaty in 1783 confirmed the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire, and resulted in the United States taking possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River.
The American Revolution was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in American society, government and ways of thinking.
Americans rejected the aristocracies that dominated Europe at the time, championing instead the development of republicanism based on the Enlightenment understanding of liberalism .
Virtue was the goal and corruption was the enemy.
Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government responsible to the will of the people .
However, sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of democracy desirable in the new government, with a number of Founders fearing mob rule .
Fundamental issues of national governance were settled with the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788, which replaced the weaker Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union .
In contrast to the loose confederation , the Constitution established a relatively stronger federal national government.
The United States Bill of Rights of 1791 is the first ten amendments to the Constitution, guaranteeing many " natural rights " that were influential in justifying the revolution, and attempted to balance a strong national government with strong state governments and broad personal liberties .
The American shift to liberal republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in the United States. 200px This is an alphabetical list of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America .
This list uses the most inclusive definition of North America, which covers the landmass north of the Panama - Colombia border, and the islands of the Caribbean .
North America is the northern continent of the Americas , situated in the Earth 's northern hemisphere and almost totally in the western hemisphere .
It is bordered on the north by the Arctic Ocean , on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean , on the southeast by the Caribbean Sea , and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean ; South America lies to the southeast.
How the West Was Won is a 1962 American epic - Western film. The picture was one of the last "old- fashioned" epic films made by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer to enjoy great success.
Set between 1839 and 1889, it follows four generations of a family (starting as the Prescotts) as they move ever westward, from western New York state to the Pacific Ocean .
The picture was filmed in the curved- screen three-projector Cinerama process.
The fundamental idea behind the film was to provide an episodic retelling of the progress of westward migration and development of America.
It was inspired by a much longer and more complex series of historical narratives that appeared as a photo essay series, by the same name, three years earlier in Life magazine, which is acknowledged in the film’s credits.
The all-star cast includes (in alphabetical order) Carroll Baker , Walter Brennan , Lee J.
Cobb , Andy Devine , Henry Fonda , Carolyn Jones , Karl Malden , Harry Morgan , Gregory Peck , George Peppard , Robert Preston , Debbie Reynolds , James Stewart , Eli Wallach , John Wayne , and Richard Widmark .
The film is narrated by Spencer Tracy .
The movie consists of five segments, three directed by Henry Hathaway ("The Rivers", "The Plains" and "The Outlaws"), and one each by John Ford ("The Civil War") and George Marshall ("The Railroad"), with transitional sequences by the uncredited Richard Thorpe .
The screenplay was written by John Gay (uncredited) and James R.
Webb .
Popular western author Louis L'Amour wrote a novelization of the screenplay.
In 1997, How the West Was Won was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
The score was listed at #25 on AFI 's 100 Years of Film Scores .

Afghan cuisine is largely based upon the nation's chief crops; cereals like wheat , maize , barley and rice .
Accompanying these staples are dairy products ( yogurt and whey ), various nuts , and native vegetables, as well as fresh and dried fruits; Afghanistan is well known for its grapes .
Afghanistan 's culinary specialties reflect its ethnic and geographic diversity.
Though it has similarities with neighboring countries, Afghan cuisine is undeniably unique.
Volcanic Pipe Volcanic pipes are geological structures formed by the violent, supersonic eruption of deep-origin volcanoes .
They are considered to be a type of diatreme .
Volcanic pipes are composed of a deep, narrow cone of solidified magma (described as "carrot-shaped"), and are usually largely composed of one of two characteristic rock types — kimberlite or lamproite .
These rocks reflect the composition of the volcanoes' deep magma sources, where the Earth is rich in magnesium .
Volcanic pipes are relatively rare.
They are well known as the primary source of diamonds , and are mined for this purpose.

The cast of the sixth season of Weeds.
Left to right: Alexander Gould , Hunter Parrish , Mary-Louise Parker , Kevin Nealon and Justin Kirk .
The American dark comedy-drama series Weeds was created by Jenji Kohan and aired on premium cable channel Showtime .
Mary-Louise Parker stars as Nancy Botwin, a suburban widow who begins selling marijuana to support her family.
Elizabeth Perkins also starred as Nancy's neighbor, Celia Hodes, a manic PTA mother, but Perkins departed the series at the end of the fifth season.
The show follows a serialized format and details Nancy's progressively deeper involvement in illegal activity as she takes care of her family.
The ten-episode first season premiered on August 5, 2005 and concluded on October 10, 2005.
Season two, which comprises 12 episodes, began airing on August 14, 2006 and finished its run on October 30, 2006.
The series' third season received an order of 15 episodes, premiered on August 13, 2007 and ran until November 20, 2007.
The 13-episode fourth season premiered early the following summer on June 16, 2008 and concluded on September 15, 2008.
Seasons one, two and three have been released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats in Regions 1, 2 and 4 .
At the 2008 Television Critics Association , it was announced that Weeds had been picked up for fifth and sixth seasons of 13 episodes each.
An eighth and final season premiered in July 1, 2012 and concluded September 16, 2012.
At the completion of the sixth season, Jenji Kohan remarked that, “In my mind, it is [the last season].
Everyone’s contract is up next year, [including] the actors and mine.
Seven years is a good run, and I’d rather leave while on top.” However, halfway through the seventh- season run, Showtime Entertainment president David Nevins remarked that he is “optimistic” that the show will be renewed.
Kohan also expressed hope that the show would be renewed.
Regardless of renewal, the seventh- season finale was crafted to “stand up on its own as a series finale if it has to or be a prelude to an eighth season.” An eighth season was announced in November 2011, almost two months after the seventh season finale.
On June 13, 2012 it was announced that season eight would be the final season.
Weeds has steadily gained live viewers from season to season.
The first season premiered to 540,000 viewers and averaged 380,000 viewers to become Showtime's highest-rated original series in 2005.
Season two averaged 160,000 more viewers than season one after 570,000 viewers tuned in to the premiere; the finale received 626,000 viewers.
The third season's debut was watched live by 824,000 viewers and the finale by 737,000 such that viewership was up 19% from the second season.
Season four premiered to 1.3 million live viewers to become what was at the time "Showtime's most-watched single original telecast in at least four years." The first airing of the finale was watched by one million viewers and multiple airings of episodes throughout the week after their initial broadcasts averaged 2.72 million viewers—16% more than the third.
A total of 102 episodes of Weeds were broadcast over eight seasons, with the series finale airing on September 16, 2012. A graduate school is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate ( bachelor's ) degree.
A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study do not provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools , which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine , business , engineering , ministry or law .
Many universities award graduate degrees; a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution.
While the term "graduate school" is typical in the United States and often used elsewhere (e.g., the UK and Canada), " postgraduate education " is also used in some English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the UK) to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelor's degree.
Those attending graduate schools are called "graduate students" (in both American and British English ), or often in British English as "postgraduate students" and, colloquially, "postgraduates" and "postgrads".
Degrees awarded to graduate students include master's degrees, doctoral degrees , and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees .
Producing original research is often a significant component of graduate studies, including the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation .
The term "graduate school" is primarily North American .
Additionally, in North America, the term does not usually refer to medical school (whose students are called "medical students"), and only occasionally refers to law school or business school . (The latter types of programs are often collectively termed professional schools ).
Although graduate school programs are distinct experiences from undergraduate degree programs, graduate instruction (in Australia , the United States , and other countries) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and departments who teach undergraduate courses.
Unlike in undergraduate programs, however, it is rare for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level.
At the Ph.D. level, though, it is quite common to take courses from a wider range of study, for which some fixed portion of coursework, sometimes known as a residency, is typically required to be taken from outside the department and college of the degree- seeking candidate, to broaden the research abilities of the student.
Some institutions designate separate graduate versus undergraduate staff and denote other divisions (often called School of X, e.g., diplomacy) Thank Me Later is the debut studio album by Canadian recording artist Drake , released on June 15, 2010, by Young Money Entertainment , Cash Money Records , and Universal Motown Records .
Production for the album took place at various recording studios during 2009 to 2010 and was mostly produced by longtime collaborators Noah "40" Shebib and Boi-1da .
It also featured contributions from Timbaland , Swizz Beatz , Nicki Minaj , Lil Wayne , The-Dream , and Kanye West , among others.
Thank Me Later has a languorous, ambient production that incorporates moody synthesizers , sparse beats, obscured keyboards, minor keys , and subtle arrangements . Thematically, the album focuses on Drake's introduction to fame and his romances over the course of confessional, club-oriented, and sexual songs.
Drake's emotionally transparent, self- deprecating lyrics are delivered in both rapped and subtly sung verses, and explore feelings of doubt, insecurity, and heartbreak.
Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Drake's personal themes and drew musical comparisons to the works of hip hop artists Kanye West and Kid Cudi .
Following an anticipated release, it debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 on first-week sales of 447,000 copies, and attained platinum certification in Canada within its debut week.
All four of the album's singles became hits on the Billboard Hot 100 , including the top-10 hit " Find Your Love ".
Thank Me Later was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and, as of February 2012, has sold 1,551,000 copies in the US. Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.
A blood type (also called a blood group) is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).
These antigens may be proteins , carbohydrates , glycoproteins , or glycolipids , depending on the blood group system.
Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various tissues .
Several of these red blood cell surface antigens can stem from one allele (or very closely linked genes ) and collectively form a blood group system.
Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents.
A total of 32 human blood group systems are now recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). There exist 4 major blood types; O, A, AB and B.
These can be further subdivided into +/- (i.e., O+, A–), denoting the presence or absence of Rh antigen.
Many pregnant women carry a fetus with a blood type different from their own, and the mother can form antibodies against fetal RBCs. Sometimes these maternal antibodies are IgG , a small immunoglobulin, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis of fetal RBCs, which in turn can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn called erythroblastosis fetalis, an illness of low fetal blood counts that ranges from mild to severe.
Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus; in these cases it is called hydrops fetalis.
The USCG Utility Boat, or UTB, is a standard utility boat used by the United States Coast Guard for a variety of inshore missions.
The 41 ft (12 m) UTB is designed to operate under moderate weather and sea conditions where its speed and maneuverability make it an ideal platform.
There are presently 172 operational boats.
Currently these boats are being phased out, although many will remain in operation for several years to come.
The boats are welded 5086 aluminum , with a molded fiberglass superstructure and twin Cummins diesel engines with conventional shafts and propellers.
They are capable of light towing, and were originally fitted with demountable fire monitors, although most have been removed.
Typical boat crew is 3.
They were constructed at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1972 to 1979. Beginning in 2008, these aging boats will be retired and replaced with the Response Boat-Medium over a 6–10 year period.
This is a list of Star Wars novels, novellas, and short stories.
Beginning with the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Lucasfilm has divided their titles into different eras with symbols designating such.
Consequently this list does not include journals, graphic novels, or comic books.
However, for a complete list of Star Wars comic books and graphic novels please refer to Star Wars Comic Books .
Notes: (E) stands for an ebook novella, which is found only online or combined with other books. (A) means that the novel is also available as an audiobook, which is found also online or combined with other books i.e. audible.com (Y) stands for young reader books, which are usually shorter than normal Star Wars books. (BBY) & (ABY) stand for Before and After the Battle of Yavin , which occurs at the end of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope .
Disturbing tha Peace (DTP) is a record label founded by Christopher "Ludacris" Bridges , his manager Chaka Zulu and Zulu's brother Jeff Dixon.
Today it operates as a subsidiary of Universal Music Group , and is distributed by The Island Def Jam Music Group .
Great Britain (, , , ), also known as Britain , is an island to the north-west of Continental Europe .
It is the ninth largest island in the world , the largest European island and the largest of the British Isles .
With a population of about 62 million people in mid-2010, it is the third most populous island in the world, after Java and Honshū .
It is surrounded by over 1,000 smaller islands and islets .
The island of Ireland lies to its west.
Politically, Great Britain also refers to the island itself together with a number of surrounding islands, which constitute the territory of England , Scotland and Wales .
All of the island is territory of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , and most of the United Kingdom's territory is in Great Britain.
Most of England, Scotland, and Wales are on the island of Great Britain, as are their respective capital cities: London , Edinburgh , and Cardiff .
The Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland with the Acts of Union 1707 on 1 May 1707 under Queen Anne .
In 1801, under a new Act of Union , this kingdom merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .
After the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) most of Ireland seceded from the Union, which then became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The variety of fauna and flora is limited in comparison to continental Europe due to the island's size and the fact that wildlife has had little time to develop since the last glacial period .
For fungi there is not sufficient information available for meaningful comparisons to be made.
The high level of urbanisation on the island has contributed to a species extinction rate that is about 100 times greater than the background species extinction rate.
Seawater is water from a sea or ocean .
On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, or 599 mM ). This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium () and chloride () ions ).
Average density at the surface is 1.025 g / ml .
Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 g/ml @ ) because the dissolved salts add mass without contributing significantly to the volume.
The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases.
At typical salinity it freezes at about .
The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured .
Seville (; , , ) is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Andalusia and the province of Seville , Spain .
It is situated on the plain of the River Guadalquivir .
The inhabitants of the city are known as sevillanos (feminine form: sevillanas) or hispalenses, after the Roman name of the city, Hispalis.
Seville has a municipal population of about 703,000 as of 2011, and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, making it the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 30th most populous municipality in the European Union .
Its Old Town , the third largest in Europe with an area of 4 km2, contains three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Alcázar palace complex , the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies .
The Seville harbour, located about 80 km from the Atlantic Ocean , is the only river port in Spain.
Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis, and was known as Ishbiliya ( Arabic :) after the Muslim conquest in 712.
During the Muslim rule in Spain, Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of Córdoba before becoming the independent Taifa of Seville ; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248.
After the discovery of the Americas, Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) wielded its power, opening a Golden Age of arts and literature.
In 1519, Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth.
Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history, the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city's culture; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of Cádiz .
The 20th century in Seville saw the horrors of the Spanish Civil War , decisive cultural milestones such as the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 and Expo'92 , and the city's election as the capital of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia .
Coatesville is a town in Clay Township , Hendricks County , Indiana , United States .
The population was 523 at the 2010 Census .
Connective tissue (CT) is a kind of biological tissue that supports, connects, or separates different types of tissues and organs of the body.
It is one of the four general classes of biological tissues—the others of which are epithelial , muscular , and nervous tissues.
All CT has three main components: cells, fibers, and extracellular matrices, all immersed in the body fluids. Connective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper , special connective tissue, and series of other, less classifiable types of connective tissues.
Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.) Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue , adipose tissue , cartilage , bone , and blood .
Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues.
Fibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT. Type-I collagen , is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body.
April is the fourth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars , and one of four months with a length of 30 days .
April ( ) is commonly associated with the season of spring in the Northern hemisphere and autumn in the Southern hemisphere , where it is the seasonal equivalent to October in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.
April starts on the same day of the week as July in all years, and January in leap years.
April ends on the same day of the week as December every year.

The Korean War ( Korean :         or ; 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) was a war between the Republic of Korea (South Korea), supported by the United Nations , and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), at one time supported by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union .
It was primarily the result of the political division of Korea by an agreement of the victorious Allies at the conclusion of the Pacific War at the end of World II War II II . The Korean Peninsula was ruled by the Empire of Japan from 1910 until the end of World War II. Following the surrender of the Empire of Japan in September 1945, American administrators divided the peninsula along the 38th parallel , with U.S. military forces occupying the southern half and Soviet military forces occupying the northern half.
The failure to hold free elections throughout the Korean Peninsula in 1948 deepened the division between the two sides; the North established a communist government, while the South established a right-wing government .
The 38th parallel increasingly became a political border between the two Korean states.
Although reunification negotiations continued in the months preceding the war, tension intensified.
Cross-border skirmishes and raids at the 38th Parallel persisted.
The situation escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950.
In 1950, the Soviet Union boycotted the United Nations Security Council , in protest at representation of China by the Kuomintang / Republic of China government, which had taken refuge in Taiwan following defeat in the Chinese Civil War .
In the absence of a dissenting voice from the Soviet Union, who could have vetoed it, the United States and other countries passed a Security Council resolution authorizing military intervention in Korea. The United States of America provided 88% of the 341,000 international soldiers which aided South Korean forces in repelling the invasion, with twenty other countries of the United Nations offering assistance.
Suffering severe casualties within the first two months, the defenders were pushed back to a small area in the south of the Korean Peninsula , known as the Pusan perimeter .
A rapid U.N. counter-offensive then drove the North Koreans past the 38th Parallel and almost to the Yalu River , when the People's Republic of China (PRC) entered the war on the side of North Korea.
Chinese intervention forced the Southern-allied forces to retreat behind the 38th Parallel.
While not directly committing forces to the conflict, the Soviet Union provided material aid to both the North Korean and Chinese armies.
The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when the armistice agreement was signed.
The agreement restored the border between the Koreas near the 38th Parallel and created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a -wide fortified buffer zone between the two Korean nations.
Minor incidents still continue today.
From a military science perspective, it combined strategies and tactics of World War I and World War II: it began with a mobile campaign of swift infantry attacks followed by air bombing raids, but became a static trench war by July 1951.
A continual improvement process, also often called a continuous improvement process (abbreviated as CIP or CI), is an ongoing effort to improve products, services, or processes.
These efforts can seek "incremental" improvement over time or "breakthrough" improvement all at once.
Delivery (customer valued) processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility.
Some see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems (such as business process management , quality management , project management , and program management ).
W.
Edwards Deming , a pioneer of the field, saw it as part of the 'system' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against organisational goals.
The fact that it can be called a management process does not mean that it needs to be executed by 'management'; but rather merely that it makes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design of the delivery process itself.
Frank Lloyd Wright (born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures and completed 532 works.
Wright believed in designing structures which were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture .
This philosophy was best exemplified by his design for Fallingwater (1935), which has been called "the best all-time work of American architecture".
Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.
His work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums.
Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass .
Wright authored 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio .
Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as "the greatest American architect of all time." A medieval ship flag captured by forces from Lübeck in the 1420s showed the arms of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Pomerania.
The original flag was destroyed during a World War II attack on the city, but a 19th century copy remains in Frederiksborg Palace , Denmark.
The saint accompanying the Virgin Mary and infant Christ is Saint James the Greater , identified by his scallop shell emblem.
A maritime flag is a flag designated for use on ships , boats , and other watercraft.
Naval flags are considered important at sea and the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced.
The flag flown is related to the country of registration : so much so that the word "flag" is often used symbolically as a synonym for "country of registration".
Points, sometimes also called a "discount point", are a form of pre-paid interest .
One point equals one percent of the loan amount.
By charging a borrower points, a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the amount of the stated interest rate .
Borrowers can offer to pay a lender points as a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan, thus obtaining a lower monthly payment in exchange for this up-front payment.
For each point purchased, the loan rate is typically reduced by 1/8% (0.125%).
Paying Points represent a calculated gamble on the part of the buyer.
There will be a specific point in the timeline of the loan where the money spent to buy down the interest rate will be equal to the money saved by making reduced loan payments resulting from the lower interest rate on the loan.
Selling the property or refinancing prior to this break-even point will result in a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer.
The longer you keep the property financed under the loan with purchased points, the more the money spent on the points will pay off.
Accordingly, if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion, buying points is actually going to end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher interest rate.
Points may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of qualifying for a loan.
Loan qualification based on monthly income versus the monthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly payment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate, thereby reducing the monthly loan payment.
Discount points may be different from origination fee or broker fee .
Discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates, while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate.
Origination fee and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement .
The difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a benefit to the borrower.
If you intend to stay in your home for an extended period of time, it may be worthwhile to pay additional points in order to obtain a lower interest rate.
Any significant changes in fees should be re-disclosed in the final good faith estimate (GFE). Also directly related to points is the concept of the ' no closing cost loan '.
If points are paid to acquire a loan, it is impossible at the same time for a broker bank or lender to make a premium for a higher rate.
When premium is earned by making the note rate higher, this premium is sometimes used to pay the closing costs. 311 (pronounced "three-eleven") is an American rock band from Omaha , Nebraska .
The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist/guitarist Nick Hexum , lead guitarist Jim Watson (who would later be replaced by Tim Mahoney), bassist Aaron "P-Nut" Wills and drummer Chad Sexton.
In 1992, Doug "SA" Martinez joined to sing and provide turntables for 311's later albums, rounding out the current line-up. 311 is generally known as an alternative rock band, but it is also classified as rap rock , rap metal , funk rock , funk metal , reggae and jazz fusion .
The band's name originates from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha, Nebraska, after the original guitarist for the band was arrested for streaking .
After a series of independent releases, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums Music (1993) and Grassroots (1994) to moderate success.
They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum self-titled album , which reached No. 12 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the singles " Down " and " All Mixed Up ", the former of which topped the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996.
The band's next three albums, Transistor (1997), Soundsystem (1999) and From Chaos (2001), did not achieve the massive success of the self-titled album, though they were still successful, with the first going platinum and the last two going gold.
Their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits '93–'03 was also certified gold.
The band's most recent studio album is 2011's Universal Pulse .
To date, 311 has released ten studio albums, one live album, four compilation albums, four EPs and four DVDs. As of 2011, 311 has sold over 8.5 million records in the US. They are currently working on a new album, which is due for release in 2013.
Denton True "Cy" Young (March 29, 1867 – November 4, 1955) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher .
During his 22-year baseball career (1890–1911), he pitched for five different teams.
Young established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for a century.
Young compiled 511 wins , which is most in Major League history and 94 ahead of Walter Johnson who is second on the list.
Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.
One year after Young's death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the previous season's best pitcher.
In addition to wins, Young still holds the major league records for most career innings pitched (7,355), most career games started (815), and most complete games (749).
He also retired with 316 losses , the most in MLB history.
Young's 76 career shutouts are fourth all-time.
He also won at least 30 games in a season five times, with ten other seasons of 20 or more wins.
In addition, Young pitched three no- hitters , including the third perfect game in baseball history, first in baseball's "modern era". In 1999, 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death, editors at The Sporting News ranked Cy Young 14th on their list of "Baseball's 100 Greatest Players".
That same year, baseball fans named him to the Major League Baseball All- Century Team .
Young's career started in 1890 with the Cleveland Spiders .
After eight years with the Spiders, Young was moved to St. Louis in 1899.
After two years there, Young jumped to the newly-created American League , joining the Boston franchise.
He was traded back to Cleveland in 1909, before spending the final two months of his career with the Boston Rustlers .
After his retirement, Young went back to his farm in Ohio , where he stayed until his death at age 88 in 1955.
A fiscal year (or financial year, or sometimes budget year) is a period used for calculating annual ("yearly") financial statements in businesses and other organizations.
In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the period reported on constitutes a calendar year (that is, 1 January to 31 December).
Fiscal years vary between businesses and countries.
The "fiscal year" may also refer to the year used for income tax reporting.
Some companies choose to end their fiscal year on the same day of the week, such day being the one closest to a particular date (for example, the Friday closest to 31 December).
Under such a system, some fiscal years will have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks.
Major corporations that adopt this approach include Cisco Systems .
In the United Kingdom, a number of major corporations that were once government owned, such as BT Group and the National Grid , continue to use the government's financial year, which ends on the last day of March, as they have found no reason to change since privatisation .
Nevertheless, the fiscal year is identical to the calendar year for about 65% of publicly traded companies in the United States and for a majority of large corporations in the UK and elsewhere (with notable exceptions Australia, New Zealand and Japan).
Many universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer, both to align the fiscal year with the school year (and, in some cases involving public universities, with the state government's fiscal year), and because the school is normally less busy during the summer months.
In the Northern hemisphere this is July in one year to June in the next year.
In the southern hemisphere this is January to December of a single calendar year.
Some media/communication based organizations use a broadcast calendar as the basis for their fiscal year.
Gertrude Stein , 1935 The sentence "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." was written by Gertrude Stein as part of the 1913 poem Sacred Emily, which appeared in the 1922 book Geography and Plays.
In that poem, the first "Rose" is the name of a person.
Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and "A rose is a rose is a rose" is probably her most famous quotation, often interpreted as meaning "things are what they are," a statement of the law of identity , "A is A". In Stein's view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the rose as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked "Now listen!
I’m no fool.
I know that in daily life we don't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ...' Yes, I’m no fool; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years." (Four in America)  She herself said to an audience at Oxford University that the statement referred to the fact that when the Romantics used the word "rose" it had a direct relationship to an actual rose.
For later periods in literature this would no longer be true.
The eras following romanticism, notably the modern era, use the word rose to refer to the actual rose, yet they also imply, through the use of the word, the archetypical elements of the romantic era.
An embossed foil Notary Seal from the State of New York .
A notary public (or notary or public notary) in the common law world is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business.
A notary's main functions are to administer oaths and affirmations, take affidavits and statutory declarations , witness and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents, take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances, protest notes and bills of exchange, provide notice of foreign drafts, prepare marine or ship's protests in cases of damage, provide exemplifications and notarial copies, and perform certain other official acts depending on the jurisdiction .
Any such act is known as a notarization.
The term notary public only refers to common-law notaries and should not be confused with civil-law notaries .
With the exceptions of Louisiana , Puerto Rico , Quebec , whose private law is based on civil law , and British Columbia , whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice, a notary public in the rest of the United States and most of Canada has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar: such notaries may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
Therefore, at common law, notarial service is distinct from the practice of law , and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to lay notaries such as those appointed throughout most of the United States of America.
Leaving Las Vegas is a 1995 romantic drama film directed and written by Mike Figgis , based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien .
Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas .
While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute , played by Elisabeth Shue , which forms the center of the film.
O'Brien committed suicide two weeks after production of the film started.
A halt was considered, but work continued as a tribute.
Leaving Las Vegas was filmed in super 16mm instead of 35 mm film which is most commonly used for mainstream film, although 16 mm is common for art house films.
After limited release in the United States on October 27, 1995, Leaving Las Vegas made its nationwide release on February 9, 1996, receiving strong praise from critics and audiences. Cage received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor , while Shue was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress .
The film also received nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director .
A coordinate measuring machine is a device for measuring the physical geometrical characteristics of an object.
This machine may be manually controlled by an operator or it may be computer controlled.
Measurements are defined by a probe attached to the third moving axis of this machine.
Probes may be mechanical, optical, laser, or white light, amongst others.
A machine which takes readings in six degrees of freedom and displays these readings in mathematical form is known as a CMM. Coordinate Measuring Machine Coordinate Measuring Machine In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body .
A significant fraction of the human body is water.
Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that "the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight.
In a newborn infant, this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight, but it progressively decreases from birth to old age, most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life.
Also, obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body, sometimes to as low as 45 percent".
These figures are statistical averages, so are illustrative, and like all biostatistics, will vary with things like type of population, age and number of people sampled, and methodology.
So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure.
For example, Jackson's (1985) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60% for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water, which approximates Guyton's 57%.
In diseased states where body water is affected, the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem.
Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide .
Per Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology, body water is broken down into the following compartments: Intracellular fluid (2/3 of body water).
Per Guyton, in a body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5% (5/8), close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb.
Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular.
Extracellular fluid (1/3 of body water).
Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5% Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here.
Plasma (1/5 of extracellular fluid).
Per Guyton's illustration, of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid, plasma volume averages 3 litres.
This amounts to 20%, the same as per Netter's Atlas.
Interstitial fluid (4/5 of extracellular fluid) Transcellular fluid (a.k.a. "third space," normally ignored in calculations) Contained inside organs, such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal, and ocular fluids.
Police officers buying doughnuts and coffee, an example of perceived stereotypical behavior in North America.
A stereotype is a thought that may be adopted about specific types of individuals or certain ways of doing things, but that belief may or may not accurately reflect reality . However, this is only a fundamental psychological definition of a stereotype.
Within and across different psychology disciplines, there are different concepts and theories of stereotyping that provide their own expanded definition.
Some of these definitions share commonalities, though each one may also harbor unique aspects that may complement or contradict the others.
The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century.
Plate motion based on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite data from NASA JPL . The vectors show direction and magnitude of motion.
Remnants of the Farallon Plate , deep in Earth's mantle.
It is thought that much of the plate initially went under North America (particularly the western United States and southwest Canada) at a very shallow angle, creating much of the mountainous terrain in the area (particularly the southern Rocky Mountains ).
Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the "pertaining to building") is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motions of Earth 's lithosphere .
The model builds on the concepts of continental drift , developed during the first decades of the 20th century.
It was accepted by the geoscientific community after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates .
On Earth, there are seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates.
Where plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent , divergent , or transform .  Earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain -building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries.
The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually.
Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust .
Along convergent boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle ; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading.
In this way, the total surface of the globe remains the same.
This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle.
Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) proposed gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.
Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has a higher strength and lower density than the underlying asthenosphere .
Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection .
Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in differences in gravitational forces ) and drag , downward suction , at the subduction zones.
Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon .
The relative importance of each of these factors is unclear, and is still subject to debate (see also below).
South America, earlier known simply as America (1507–1538), is a continent located in the Western Hemisphere , mostly in the Southern Hemisphere , with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere . It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas .
It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean ; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest.
It includes twelve sovereign states – Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Paraguay , Peru , Suriname , Uruguay , and Venezuela – and two non-sovereign areas – French Guiana , an overseas region of France , and the Falkland Islands , a British Overseas Territory .
In addition to this, Trinidad and Tobago and the ABC islands of the Netherlands may also be considered part of South America.
South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi).
Its population as of 2005 has been estimated at more than 371,090,000.
South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia , Africa , and North America ) and fifth in population (after Asia , Africa , Europe , and North America ).  Most of the population lives near the western or eastern coasts of the continent while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated.
The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains, in contrast to the eastern large river basins in the Amazon , Paraná and Orinoco .
Most of the continent lies in the tropics .
The continent is culturally, ethnically and racially diverse; hosting cultures and peoples originating in South America as well as Europe, Africa and Asia.
Given a history of colonialism most South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese and societies and states are commonly modeled after Western traditions .
Child care or day care is the care of a child during the day by a person other than the child's legal guardians , typically performed by someone outside the child's immediate family .
Day care is typically an ongoing service during specific periods, such as the parents' time at work .
The service is known as child care in the United Kingdom and Australia and child care or day care in North America (although child care also has a broader meaning).
Child care is provided in nurseries or crèches or by a nanny or family child care provider caring for children in their own homes.
It can also take on a more formal structure, with education, child development, discipline and even preschool education falling into the fold of services.
Some childminders care for children from several families at the same time, either in their own home (commonly known as "family day care" in Australia) or in a specialized child care facility.
Some employers provide nursery provisions for their employees at or near the place of employment.
Child care in the child's own home is traditionally provided by a nanny or au pair , or by extended family members including grandparents, aunts and uncles.
Mars as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope .
The geology of Mars is the scientific study of the surface, crust, and interior of the planet Mars .
It emphasizes the composition, structure, history, and physical processes that shape the planet.
It is fully analogous to the field of terrestrial geology .
In planetary science , the term geology is used in its broadest sense to mean the study of the solid parts of planets and moons.
The term incorporates aspects of geophysics , geochemistry , mineralogy , geodesy , and cartography . A neologism , areology, from the Greek word Arēs (Mars), sometimes appears as a synonym for Mars' geology in the popular media and works of science fiction (e.g., Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy ), but the term is rarely, if ever, used by professional geologists and planetary scientists.
Harley-Davidson Inc (, formerly HDI), often abbreviated H-D or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer.
Founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin , during the first decade of the 20th century, it was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression .
Harley-Davidson also survived a period of poor quality control and competition from Japanese manufacturers.
The company sells today only heavyweight motorcycles with over 750 cc , designed for cruising on highways.
Harley-Davidson motorcycles, or "Harleys", are noted for the tradition of heavy customization that gave rise to the chopper style of motorcycle.
Except for the modern VRSC model family, current Harley-Davidson motorcycles reflect the styles of classic Harley designs.
Harley-Davidson's attempts to establish itself in the light motorcycle market have met little success and have largely been abandoned since the 1978 sale of its Italian Aermacchi subsidiary.
Harley-Davidson sustains a large brand community which keeps active through clubs, events, and a museum.
Licensing of the Harley-Davidson brand and logo accounted for $40 million (0.8%) of the company's net revenue in 2010.
Fleas are the insects forming the order Siphonaptera.
They are wingless, with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood .
Fleas are external parasites , living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds .
Some flea species include: Cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) Dog flea (Ctenocephalides canis) Human flea (Pulex irritans) Moorhen flea (Dasypsyllus gallinulae) Northern rat flea (Nosopsyllus fasciatus) Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) Over 2,000 species have been described worldwide.
Deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae.
Species in the Cervidae family include white-tailed deer , mule deer such as black-tailed deer , elk , moose , red deer , reindeer (caribou), fallow deer , roe deer and chital .
Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer ) and also female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year.
In this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope ; these are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance.
The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families, Moschidae and Tragulidae , respectively.  The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election .
It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008.
Democrat Barack Obama , then the junior Senator from Illinois , defeated Republican John McCain , the senior Senator from Arizona .
As the campaign progressed, the War in Iraq and outgoing Republican President George W.
Bush had become increasingly unpopular, and the major- party candidates ran on a platform of change and reform. Domestic policy and the economy eventually emerged as the main themes in the last few months of the election campaign after the onset of the worst recession since the 1930s .
Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain in both the electoral and popular vote.
Obama received the most votes for a presidential candidate in American history, and won the popular and electoral vote by the largest margin in 12 years , as well as the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century .
This was the first U.S. presidential election in which an African American was elected, having also been the first in which an African American won the nomination of either major party.
This election was also notable for being the first time in U.S. history that both major party candidates were sitting U.S.
Senators, only the third time (after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting U.S.
Senator was elected president, and only the second time that the winning President and Vice President (Obama and Biden) were both sitting U.S.
Senators.
This was also the first election since 1952 in which neither of the major parties' nominees was the incumbent President or Vice President.
Disney Channel is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by the Disney-ABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company .
Aimed mainly at pre-teens and teenagers 9–14 years of age and its preschooler-targeted shows aimed at children 2–6, its programming consists of original first-run television series , theatrically-released and original made- for-cable movies and select other third- party programming.
The channel's programs were originally marketed towards families, and then to younger children by the late 1990s, although its viewing audience has diversified since the mid-2000s to include older teenagers and adults.
The U.S. channel is also the flagship property of Disney Channels Worldwide (currently run by President and Chief Creative Officer Gary Marsh ), a group of more than 90 entertainment channels aimed at children and families that is available in over 160 countries and 30 languages (platform brands that are part of the unit, in addition to Disney Channel, include Disney XD , Disney Junior , Disney Cinemagic , Hungama TV and Radio Disney ).  Accounts receivable is money owed to a business by its clients (customers or debtors) and shown on its balance sheet as an asset.
It is one of a series of accounting transactions dealing with the billing of a customer for goods and services that the customer has ordered.
These may be distinguished from notes receivable, which are debts created through formal legal instruments called promissory notes .
Shoulder problems including pain , are one of the more common reasons for physician visits for musculoskeletal symptoms.
The shoulder is the most movable joint in the body.
However, it is an unstable joint because of the range of motion allowed.
This instability increases the likelihood of joint injury, often leading to a degenerative process in which tissues break down and no longer function well.
Shoulder pain may be localized or may be deferred to areas around the shoulder or down the arm.
Disease within the body (such as gallbladder , liver , or heart disease , or disease of the cervical spine of the neck) also may generate pain that the brain may interpret as arising from the shoulder.
Conversely, pain felt in the region of the shoulder blade or scapula nearly always has its origin in the neck. WAsP (Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program) is a PC program for predicting wind climates, wind resources, and power productions from wind turbines and wind farms .
The predictions are based on wind data measured at meteorological stations in the same region.
The program includes a complex terrain flow model, a roughness change model, a model for sheltering obstacles, and a wake model.
The software package further contains a Climate Analyst for creating the wind- climatological inputs, a Map Editor for creating and editing the topographical inputs, and a Turbine Editor for creating the wind turbine inputs to WAsP.
The fundamentals of WAsP and the wind atlas methodology are described in the European Wind Atlas.
WAsP is developed and distributed by the Department of Wind Energy at the Technical University of Denmark , Denmark .
Current version is 10.2.
WAsP is used for: Wind farm production Wind farm efficiency Micro-siting of wind turbines Power production calculations Wind resource mapping Wind climate estimation Wind atlas generation Wind data analysis The 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak was a vigorous severe weather event that lasted from May 3 through 6, 1999 and brought violent tornadic storms to Oklahoma , Kansas , Arkansas , Texas and Tennessee .
This article concentrates primarily on the events of May 3, when 66 tornadoes broke out in Oklahoma and Kansas.
The most significant tornado first touched down southwest of Chickasha, Oklahoma , and became an F5 before dissipating near Midwest City .
The tornado tore through the southern Oklahoma City suburbs of Bridge Creek , far south Oklahoma City , Moore , Del City , Tinker Air Force Base and Midwest City, causing $1.1 billion in damage.
Forty-eight people perished during the outbreak .
This tornadic event ranks in severity with the Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1965 .
With a total of between 66 and 74 tornadoes, it was the most prolific tornado outbreak in Oklahoma history, although not the deadliest .
The Coat of Arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point.
Hairspray is a 2007 American musical film based on the 2002 Broadway musical of the same name , which in turn was based on John Waters 's 1988 comedy film of the same name .
Set in 1962 Baltimore, Maryland , the film follows the "pleasantly plump" teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against racial segregation .
Adapted from both Waters' 1988 script and Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell's book for the stage musical by screenwriter Leslie Dixon , the 2007 film version of Hairspray is directed and choreographed by Adam Shankman .
Hairspray features songs from the Broadway musical written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman , as well as four new Shaiman/Wittman compositions not present in the original Broadway version.
Opening to positive reviews, Hairspray met with financial success, breaking the record for biggest sales at opening weekend for a movie musical, which the film held until July 2008 when it was surpassed by Mamma Mia!
Hairspray went on to become the fourth highest grossing musical film in US cinema history, behind the film adaptations of Grease , Chicago , and Mamma Mia!. Available in a variety of formats, Hairsprays Region 1 home video release took place on November 20, 2007.
USA Network purchased the broadcast rights to Hairspray and was scheduled to debut the film on cable television in February 2010, but in the end it did not broadcast that month, instead the film was pushed back and premiered on USA on July 24, 2010, with sister channel Bravo also showing it multiple times, and in February 2011 aired on ABC for over-the-air broadcasts.
The Walt Disney Studios , the headquarters of The Walt Disney Company The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media corporation headquartered in Walt Disney Studios , Burbank , California.
It is the largest media conglomerate in the world in terms of revenue.
Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by Walt and Roy Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and travel.
Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media .
In addition, Disney has created new divisions of the company in order to market more mature content than it typically associates with its flagship family-oriented brands.
The company is best known for the products of its film studio, the Walt Disney Studios , and today one of the largest and best-known studios in Hollywood .
Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast television network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel , ESPN , A+E Networks , LifeTime and ABC Family ; publishing, merchandising , and theatre divisions; and owns and licenses 14 theme parks around the world .
It also has a successful music division.
The company has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since May 6, 1991.
An early and well-known cartoon creation of the company, Mickey Mouse , is the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company.
Throughout most of the 20th century, although the Republican and Democratic parties alternated in power at a national level, some states were so overwhelmingly dominated by one party that nomination was usually tantamount to election .
This was especially true in the Solid South , where the Republican Party was virtually nonexistent for the best part of a century, from the end of Reconstruction in the late 1870s to the 1960s.
Conversely, the New England states of Vermont , Maine , and New Hampshire were Republican bastions, as were some Midwestern states like Iowa and North Dakota .
However, in the 1970s and 1980s, the increasingly conservative Republican Party gradually overtook the Democrats in the southeast .
The Democrats' support in the formerly Solid South had been eroded during the vast cultural, political and economic upheaval that surrounded the 1960s.
By the 1990s the Republican Party had completed the transition into the southeast's dominant political party, despite typically having fewer members due to the prevalence of Republican voting generational Democrats .
In New England, the opposite trend took place; the former Republican strongholds of Maine and Vermont became solidly Democratic, as did formerly Republican areas of New Jersey, New York, and other states. Currently, the majority of the overall number of seats held in the state legislatures has been switching between the two parties every few years.
As of the U.S. gubernatorial elections of 2010 , the Republican party holds an outright majority of approximately 440 with 3,890 seats (53% of total) compared to the Democratic party's number of 3,450 (47% of total) seats elected on a partisan ballot.<ref name="www.ncsl.org/?tabid=21634"> Of the 7,382 seats in all of the state legislatures combined, independents and third parties account for only 15 members, not counting the 49 members of the Nebraska Legislature , which is the only legislature in the nation to hold non-partisan elections to determine its members.
Due to the results of the 2010 elections, Republicans took control of an additional 19 state legislative chambers, giving them majority control of both chambers in 25 states versus the Democrats' majority control of both chambers in only 16 states, with 8 states having split or inconclusive control of both chambers (not including Nebraska); previous to the 2010 elections, it was Democrats who controlled both chambers in 27 states versus the Republican party having total control in only 14 states, with eight states divided and Nebraska being nonpartisan.<ref name="http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?
TabID=746&tabs=1116,114,796#1116"> Bus run by biodiesel Space-filling model of methyl linoleate, or linoleic acid methyl ester, a common methyl ester produced from soybean or canola oil and methanol Space-filling model of ethyl stearate, or stearic acid ethyl ester, an ethyl ester produced from soybean or canola oil and ethanol Biodiesel refers to a vegetable oil- or animal fat-based diesel fuel consisting of long-chain alkyl ( methyl , propyl or ethyl ) esters .
Biodiesel is typically made by chemically reacting lipids (e.g., vegetable oil , animal fat ( tallow )) with an alcohol producing fatty acid esters .
Biodiesel is meant to be used in standard diesel engines and is thus distinct from the vegetable and waste oils used to fuel converted diesel engines.
Biodiesel can be used alone, or blended with petrodiesel.
Biodiesel can also be used as a low carbon alternative to heating oil .
The National Biodiesel Board (USA) also has a technical definition of "biodiesel" as a mono-alkyl ester.
The term Muslim world (also known as the Ummah or Islamosphere) has several meanings.
In a religious sense, it refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam , referred to as Muslims .
In a cultural sense, it refers to Islamic civilization, inclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization.
In a modern geopolitical sense, the term usually refers collectively to Muslim- majority countries , states, districts, or towns.
Islamic lifestyles emphasise unity and defence of fellow Muslims, although many schools and branches (see Shi'a– Sunni relations , for example) exist.
In the past both Pan-Islamism and nationalist currents have influenced the status of the Muslim world.
As of 2010, over 1.6 billion or about 23.4% of the world population are Muslims.
Of these, around 62% live in Asia - Pacific , 20% in the Middle East - North Africa , 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa , around 3% in Europe and 0.3% in the Americas .

The Falklands War ( or Guerra del Atlántico Sur), also known as the Falklands Conflict or Falklands Crisis, was a 1982 war between Argentina and the United Kingdom . The conflict resulted from the long- standing dispute over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands , which lie in the South Atlantic , east of Argentina.
The Falklands War began on Friday 2 April 1982, when Argentine forces invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands and South Georgia.
The British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force , and retake the islands by amphibious assault .
The resulting conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982, which returned the islands to British control.
During the conflict, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel and 3 Falkland Islanders died.
The conflict was the result of a protracted historical confrontation regarding the sovereignty of the islands.
Argentina has asserted that the Falkland Islands have been Argentinian territory since the 19th century and, , shows no sign of relinquishing the claim.
The claim was added to the Argentine constitution after its reformation in 1994.
As such, the Argentine government characterised their initial invasion as the re-occupation of their own territory, whilst the British government saw it as an invasion of a British dependent territory .
However, neither state officially declared war and hostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute and the local area of the South Atlantic.
The conflict had a strong impact in both countries.
Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government , which hastened its downfall.
In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's government was bolstered by the successful outcome.
The war has played an important role in the culture of both countries, and has been the subject of several books, scholarly articles, films, and songs.
Over time, the cultural and political weight of the conflict has had less effect on the British public than on that of Argentina, where the war is still a topic of discussion.
Relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid, at which the two Governments issued a joint statement which explicitly did not change either side's position on sovereignty.
Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic tetrapods that live throughout the tropics in Africa , Asia , the Americas and Australia .
Crocodylinae, in which all its members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily .
A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae , that includes the tomistoma , was excluded in this article since new genetic studies reveal the possibility of tomistoma as a close relative of the gharial .
This article applies the term crocodile only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae.
The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia : which includes all members of Crocodylidae, including the tomistoma , the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae ) and the gharials (family Gavialidae ), and the rest of Crocodylomorpha , which includes all of the prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors.
Although they appear to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to seperate biological families .
The gharial having a very unique and narrow snout is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators . The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans.
Another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator; which possesses small depressions in the upper jaw where the lower teeth fit into.
Also when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw.
For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family , the species belongs to.
Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present but non-functioning in alligators.
Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians, are the much higher levels of aggression .
All reptiles , with the exception of Testudines , are all scaled diapsids , but crocodilians are archosaurs , which means they are genetically closer to birds and the extinct dinosaurs , than other reptiles are.
Although all crocodiles are anatomically and biologically similar; their size , morphology , behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species .
However, they have many similarities in these areas as well.
All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers , lakes , wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater .
They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , birds and mammals , and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans , depending on species and age.
All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold .
They first separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.
A lineage, including the rest of Crocodylomorpha , have been around for at least 225 million years, survived multiple mass extinctions , but today, due to habitat destruction and poaching , many species are at the risk of extinction , some being classified as critically endangered .
A natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz, Jordan Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth's surface by exogenetic processes such as wind or water flow, and then transported and deposited in other locations.
While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10- 40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally.
Excessive erosion causes problems such as desertification , decreases in agricultural productivity due to land degradation, sedimentation of waterways, and ecological collapse due to loss of the nutrient rich upper soil layers .
Water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation ; combined, they are responsible for 84% of degraded acreage, making excessive erosion one of the most significant global environmental problems.
Industrial agriculture , deforestation , roads , anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion. However, there are many available alternative land use practices that can curtail or limit erosion, such as terrace - building, no-till agriculture, and revegetation of denuded soils.
Albany is the 11th largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon , and is the county seat of Linn County .
It is located in the Willamette Valley at the confluence of the Calapooia River and the Willamette River in both Linn and Benton counties, just east of Corvallis and south of Salem .
It is largely a farming and manufacturing city.
Settlers founded the community in 1848.
As of the 2010 United States Census , the population of Albany was 50,158.
Its population was estimated by the Portland Research Center to be 50,710 in 2012.
Albany has a home rule charter , a council–manager government , and a full-time unelected city manager .
The city provides the population with access to over 30 parks and trails, a senior center, and many cultural events such as River Rhythms and Mondays at Monteith.
In addition to farming and manufacturing, the city's economy depends on retail trade, health care, and social assistance.
In recent years the city has worked to revive the downtown shopping area, with help from The Central Albany Revitalization Area (CARA). Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 164220 March 1727) was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution .
His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics .
Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus .
Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries.
It also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles.
By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos.
Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum .
He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound .
In addition to his work on the calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, and developed Newton's method for approximating the roots of a function .
Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge .
He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England , perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism .  In addition to his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology , but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death.
In his later life, Newton became president of the Royal Society . He also served the British government as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint .
A police raid confiscating illegal alcohol, in Elk Lake, Canada , in 1925.
Prohibition of alcohol, often referred to simply as prohibition, is the legal act of prohibiting the manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol and alcoholic beverages .
The term can also apply to the periods in the histories of the countries during which the prohibition of alcohol was enforced.
Use of the term as applicable to a historical period is typically applied to countries of European culture.
Independence Day, commonly known as the Fourth of July, is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain .
Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks , parades, barbecues , carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games , family reunions , and political speeches and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States.
Independence Day is the national day of the United States.
The ionosphere is a region of the upper atmosphere , from about to altitude, and includes the thermosphere and parts of the mesosphere and exosphere .
It is distinguished because it is ionized by solar radiation.
It plays an important part in atmospheric electricity and forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere .
It has practical importance because, among other functions, it influences radio propagation to distant places on the Earth .
Relationship of the atmosphere and ionosphere Schroeder is a fictional character in the long-running comic strip Peanuts , created by Charles M.
Schulz .
He is distinguished by his precocious skill at playing the toy piano , as well as by his love of classical music and the composer Ludwig van Beethoven in particular.
Schroeder is also the catcher on Charlie Brown 's baseball team, though he is always seen walking back to the mound with the baseball, never throwing it— admitting in one strip he didn't want the other team to discover his lack of ability.
He is also the object of the unrequited infatuation of Lucy van Pelt , who constantly leans on Schroeder's piano.
Charlie Brown, Sally Brown, Peppermint Patty, Frieda and Snoopy are also occasionally depicted as leaning on Schroeder's piano.  After Linus and Snoopy , Schroeder is probably Charlie Brown's closest friend; he once angrily berated Violet for giving Charlie Brown a used valentine well after Valentine's Day had come and gone, only to be undercut when Charlie Brown eagerly accepted it.
Schroeder also joined Linus in dressing down the girls (Lucy, Patty, Violet and Frieda) and Snoopy in Charlie Brown's All-Stars , when it was discovered Charlie Brown wouldn't sacrifice the girls and Snoopy just to get uniforms for the baseball team.
He also is one of the few players who has any respect for Charlie Brown as a manager; however, he is as capable of ire at Charlie Brown's poor performance as anyone else, but these instances are few and far between.
In one game, when Frieda desperately asked Schroeder; "Wouldn't you like just once to see Charlie Brown hit that ball?", Schroeder's calm reply was; "No, I am not prepared to have the world come to an end". He was voted as an honorary member of the Epsilon Iota chapter at Florida State University of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity, the oldest and largest music fraternity in the world.
A stained glass window in New York's Buffalo Westminster Presbyterian Church honoring Albert Schweitzer has a corner showing Schroeder playing his toy piano.
In honor of Schroeder's passion for Beethoven, the Charles M.
Schulz Museum (Santa Rosa) and the Ira F.
Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies announced the launching in December 2009 of a permanent online exhibit of 60 of the 300 Schulz's cartoons that involve Schroeder and Beethoven: "Schulz's Beethoven, Schroeder's Muse" (accessible through the website www.americanbeethovensociety.org).
A Usenet newsgroup is a usually within the Usenet system, for messages posted from many users in different locations.
The term may be confusing to some, because it is in fact a discussion group .
Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web .
Newsreader software is used to read newsgroups.
Glutamine (abbreviated as Gln or Q) is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code .
It is not recognized as an essential amino acid , but may become conditionally essential in certain situations, including intensive athletic training or certain gastrointestinal disorders.
Its side-chain is an amide formed by replacing the side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group , making it the amide of glutamic acid .
Its codons are CAA and CAG. In human blood , glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid , with a concentration of about 500–900 μmol/l.

Breast implant: the pre-operative (left) and post-operative (right) aspects of a young woman’s bilateral breast augmentation with high-profile, 500cc silicone-gel implants.
Breast implant: The post-operative aspect of a breast cancer mastectomy ; the woman is a candidate for a primary breast-reconstruction procedure of her right breast.
A breast implant is a medical prosthesis used to augment, reconstruct, or create the physical form of breasts .
Breast implants are applied to correct the size, form, and feel of a woman’s breasts in post– mastectomy breast reconstruction ; for correcting congenital defects and deformities of the chest wall; for aesthetic breast augmentation ; and for creating breasts in the male-to- female transsexual patient.
There are three general types of breast implant device, defined by the filler material: saline, silicone, and composite.
The saline implant has an elastomer silicone shell filled with sterile saline solution ; the silicone implant has an elastomer silicone shell filled with viscous silicone gel; and the alternative composition implants featured miscellaneous fillers, such as soy oil , polypropylene string , et cetera.
In surgical practice, for the reconstruction of a breast, the tissue expander device is a temporary breast prosthesis used to form and establish an implant pocket for the permanent breast implant.
For the correction of male breast and chest-wall defects and deformities, the pectoral implant is the breast prosthesis used for the reconstruction and the aesthetic repair of a man’s chest. (See: gynecomastia and mastopexy ) Methamphetamine ( USAN ) (), also known as metamfetamine ( INN ), meth, ice, crystal, glass, tik, N- methylamphetamine, methylamphetamine, and desoxyephedrine, is a psychostimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine class of psychoactive drugs .
Methamphetamine occurs in two enantiomers , dextrorotary and levorotary ; dextromethamphetamine possesses the well-known psychostimulant effects of the drug, while levomethamphetamine is CNS - inactive.
Although rarely prescribed, methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity under the trade name Desoxyn.
Illicitly, methamphetamine may be sold either as pure dextromethamphetamine or in a racemic mixture.
Both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are Schedule II controlled substances in the United States, and similarly the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many jurisdictions .
Internationally, methamphetamine has been placed in Schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty.
In low dosages, methamphetamine can increase alertness, concentration, and energy in fatigued individuals.
In higher doses, it can induce mania with accompanying euphoria , feelings of self-esteem and increased libido .
Methamphetamine has a high potential for abuse and addiction , activating the psychological reward system by triggering a cascading release of dopamine in the brain characterized as Amphetamine/ Stimulant psychosis .
Chronic abuse may also lead to post- withdrawal syndrome , a result of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons .
Post-withdrawal syndrome can persist beyond the withdrawal period for months, and sometimes up to a year.
In addition to psychological harm, physical harm – primarily consisting of cardiovascular damage – may occur with chronic use or acute overdose.
Baptism of Neophytes by Masaccio , 15th century, Brancacci Chapel , Florence .
Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma; itself derived from βαπτισμός baptismos, washing) is a Christian rite of admission (or adoption ), almost invariably with the use of water, into the Christian Church generally and also a particular church tradition.
Baptism has been called a sacrament and an ordinance of Jesus Christ.
In some traditions, baptism is also called christening, but for others the word "christening" is reserved for the baptism of infants .
The New Testament reports that Jesus was baptized .
The usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the naked candidate to be immersed totally (submersion) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her).
While John the Baptist 's use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion, pictorial and archaeological evidence of Christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in water while water was poured over the upper body.
Other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead.
Martyrdom was identified early in Church history as "baptism by blood", enabling martyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved. Later, the Catholic Church identified a baptism of desire , by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved.
As evidenced also in the common Christian practice of infant baptism , baptism was universally seen by Christians as in some sense necessary for salvation , until Huldrych Zwingli in the 16th century denied its necessity.
Today, some Christians, particularly Quakers and the Salvation Army , do not see baptism as necessary, and do not practice the rite.
Among those that do, differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite.
Most Christians baptize "in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit " (following the Great Commission ), but some baptize in Jesus' name only .
Most Christians baptize infants ; many others hold that only believer’s baptism is true baptism.
Some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others consider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the head, is sufficient.
The term "baptism" has also been used to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name—see Other initiation ceremonies .
Zachary Michael Thomas (born September 1, 1973) is a former American college and professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for thirteen seasons.
He played college football for Texas Tech University , and was recognized as an All-American .
He was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL Draft , and played for the Dolphins his first twelve seasons in the NFL. He was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and recorded over 1,700 tackles.
A moth is an insect related to the butterfly , both being of the order Lepidoptera .
Most of this order are moths; there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth (nearly ten times the number of species of butterfly), with thousands of species yet to be described.
Most species of moth are nocturnal , but there are crepuscular and diurnal species.
African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or less commonly Afro- Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have total or partial ancestry from any of the native populations of Sub-Saharan Africa .
The term is not usually used for black residents of other countries in the Americas .
African Americans make up the single largest racial minority in the United States .
Most African Americans are of West and Central African descent and are descendants of enslaved blacks within the boundaries of the present United States.
However, some immigrants from African, Caribbean, Central American and South American nations, and their descendants, may be identified or self- identify with the term.
African-American history starts in the 16th century with black Africans forcibly taken to Spanish and English colonies in America as slaves .
After the United States came into being, black people continued to be enslaved and treated as inferiors .
These circumstances were changed by Reconstruction , development of the black community , participation in the great military conflicts of the United States , the elimination of racial segregation , and the Civil Rights Movement . In 2008, Barack Obama was the first African American to be elected president of the United States .
The geographical-origin-based term "African American" is commonly used interchangeably with "black American", although skin-color-based terms are sometimes considered disparaging.
The MIT Sloan School of Management (also known as MIT Sloan or Sloan) is the business school of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , in Cambridge , Massachusetts , USA . MIT Sloan offers bachelor's , master's , and doctoral programs, as well as non- degree executive education , and has over 20,000 alumni globally.
Its largest program is its full-time MBA , which is one of the most selective in the world, with students from more than 60 countries every year, and ranked #1 in more subjects than any other MBA program.
MIT Sloan places great emphasis on innovation and invention , and many of the world's most famous management and finance theories—including the Black–Scholes model, the binomial options pricing model , the Modigliani– Miller theorem , the neoclassical growth model , the random walk hypothesis , Theory X and Theory Y , and the field of System Dynamics —were developed at the school.
Several Nobel laureates in economics and John Bates Clark Medal winners have been on the faculty.
MIT Sloan Management Review , a leading academic journal focused on the management of innovation, has been published by the school since 1959.
The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century.
Plate motion based on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite data from NASA JPL . The vectors show direction and magnitude of motion.
Remnants of the Farallon Plate , deep in Earth's mantle.
It is thought that much of the plate initially went under North America (particularly the western United States and southwest Canada) at a very shallow angle, creating much of the mountainous terrain in the area (particularly the southern Rocky Mountains ).
Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the "pertaining to building") is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motions of Earth 's lithosphere .
The model builds on the concepts of continental drift , developed during the first decades of the 20th century.
It was accepted by the geoscientific community after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates .
On Earth, there are seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates.
Where plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent , divergent , or transform .
Earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain -building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries.
The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually.
Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust .
Along convergent boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle ; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading.
In this way, the total surface of the globe remains the same.
This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) proposed gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.
Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has a higher strength and lower density than the underlying asthenosphere .
Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection .
Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in differences in gravitational forces ) and drag , downward suction , at the subduction zones.
Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon .
The relative importance of each of these factors is unclear, and is still subject to debate (see also below).
Paracelsus (born Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 11 November or 17 December 1493 – 24 September 1541) was a German-Swiss Renaissance physician , botanist , alchemist , astrologer , and general occultist .
He founded the discipline of toxicology.
Importantly, however, he's also known as a revolutionary for insisting upon using observations of nature, rather than looking to ancient texts, in open and radical defiance of medical practice of his day.
He is also credited for giving zinc its name, calling it zincum, and for the terms "gas," "chemistry," and "alcohol." Modern psychology often also credits him for being the first to note that some diseases are rooted in psychological illness.
His personality was stubborn and independent.
He grew progressively more frustrated and bitter as he became more embattled as a reformer.
Related and somewhat synonymous terms are intelligent (data) compression and single-instance (data) storage .
The technique is used to improve storage utilization and can also be applied to network data transfers to reduce the number of bytes that must be sent.
In the deduplication process, unique chunks of data, or byte patterns, are identified and stored during a process of analysis.
As the analysis continues, other chunks are compared to the stored copy and whenever a match occurs, the redundant chunk is replaced with a small reference that points to the stored chunk.
Given that the same byte pattern may occur dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times (the match frequency is dependent on the chunk size), the amount of data that must be stored or transferred can be greatly reduced.
This type of deduplication is different from that performed by standard file- compression tools, such as LZ77 and LZ78 .
Whereas these tools identify short repeated substrings inside individual files, the intent of storage-based data deduplication is to inspect large volumes of data and identify large sections – such as entire files or large sections of files – that are identical, in order to store only one copy of it.
This copy may be additionally compressed by single-file compression techniques.
For example a typical email system might contain 100 instances of the same one megabyte (MB) file attachment.
Each time the email platform is backed up, all 100 instances of the attachment are saved, requiring 100 MB storage space.
With data deduplication, only one instance of the attachment is actually stored; the subsequent instances are referenced back to the saved copy for deduplication ratio of roughly 100 to 1. The Royal Standard used in England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and overseas The Royal Standard used in Scotland.
For other monarchs' standards, see Royal Standard .
The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is the flag used by Elizabeth II in her capacity as Sovereign of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories .
Different standards are used in the Queen's other Commonwealth realms , and the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is varied for use in Scotland .
Although almost universally called a standard, such flags when used in the United Kingdom are banners of arms , as they comprise the shield of the Royal Arms .
Outside the United Kingdom, the Royal Standard is usually a nation's banner of arms with a blue disc containing a wreath of gold roses encircling the crowned letter 'E', (for 'Elizabeth'), superimposed upon it (the Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II ).
The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is flown when the Queen is in residence in one of the royal residences.
It may be flown on any building, official or private, during a visit by the Queen, if the owner or proprietor so requests.
The Royal Standard was flown aboard the royal yacht when it was in service and the Queen was on board.
The only church that may fly a Royal Standard, even without the presence of the Sovereign, is Westminster Abbey , which is a Royal Peculiar .
Other churches generally are not allowed to hoist a Royal Standard.
The Royal Standard is flown at royal residences only when the sovereign is present.
If the Union Flag is flying above Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle instead of the Royal Standard, the Queen is not in residence.
If the ancient Royal Standard of Scotland is flying above Holyrood Palace or Balmoral Castle , instead of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland, it also indicates that the Queen is not in residence.
When the Queen attends the Parliament at the Palace of Westminster , the Royal Standard flies from Victoria Tower .
Unlike the Union Flag, the usual rule is that the Royal Standard is never flown at half-staff, even after the demise of the Crown , as there is always a sovereign on the throne .
Strictly speaking, however, the Royal Standard may be flown at half-staff above a building or on board a boat in which the unburied body of a deceased monarch is lying (as long as the present monarch is not in attendance).
When controversy arose regarding the lack of a flag at half-staff over Buckingham Palace following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, a compromise was reached whereby the Union Flag was flown at half-staff. (The Queen was then in summer residence in Balmoral; previously, no flag had flown over Buckingham Palace when the monarch was not present.
Since then, the Union Flag has been flown in the Queen's absence .) However the Union Flag can be lowered to fly at half-staff over Buckingham Palace, in times of national mourning (for example after the death of the Queen Mother , the September 11 attacks and the 7 July 2005 London bombings .
The Union Flag was also flown at half- staff over Buckingham Palace as a mark of respect on the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on Bank Holiday Monday 31 August 1998).
Brian Douglas Williams (born May 5, 1959) is the anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News , the evening news program of the NBC television network, a position he assumed in 2004.
Williams was listed among Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2007, and in 2010, a prominent media observer dubbed him "the Walter Cronkite of the 21st century." The lateral aperture is a paired structure in human anatomy.
It is an opening in each lateral extremity of the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle of the human brain , which also has a single median aperture .
The two lateral apertures provide a conduit for cerebrospinal fluid to flow from the brain's ventricular system into the subarachnoid space ; specifically into the cerebellopontine angle .
The structure is also called the lateral aperture of the fourth ventricle or the foramen of Luschka after anatomist Hubert von Luschka .
Pork chops, cooked and served.
A pork chop is a chop of pork (a meat chop ) cut perpendicularly to the spine of the pig and usually containing a rib or part of a vertebra, served as an individual portion.
Barnabus 'Barney' Stinson (born 1976) is a fictional character created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas for the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother , portrayed by Neil Patrick Harris .
One of the main characters of the show, Barney is known to enjoy being single, wear suits and play laser-tag.
He often uses different techniques and ideas to have sex with women, which is one of the show's central themes.
During the later seasons, however, he does get involved in serious relationships.
The character has been well received by critics throughout the series' run, and has been credited for much of the show's success.
He is credited for the Lemon Law and Suit Up! Non-binding price ceiling Pricing, quantity, and welfare effects of a binding price ceiling A price ceiling is a government-imposed limit on how high a price is charged for a product.
Governments intend price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make necessary commodities unattainable.
However, a price ceiling can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing.
Price ceilings can produce negative results when the correct solution would have been to increase supply.
Misuse occurs when a government misdiagnoses a price as too high when the real problem is that the supply is too low.
In an unregulated market economy price ceilings do not exist.
Students may incorrectly perceive a price ceiling as being on top of a supply and demand curve when in fact, an effective price ceiling is positioned below the equilibrium position on the graph.
Stem showing internode and nodes plus leaf petioles A stem is one of two main structural axes of a vascular plant .
The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes, the nodes hold buds which grow into one or more leaves , inflorescence (flowers), conifer cones , roots , other stems etc.
The internodes distance one node from another.
The term shoots is often confused with stems; shoots generally refer to new fresh plant growth and does include stems but also to other structures like leaves or flowers.
The other main structural axis of plants is the root .
In most plants stems are located above the soil surface but some plants have underground stems .
A stem develops buds and shoots and usually grows above the ground.
Inside the stem, materials move up and down the tissues of the transport system.
Stems have four main functions which are: Support for and the elevation of leaves, flowers and fruits .
The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits.
Transport of fluids between the roots and the shoots in the xylem and phloem .
Storage of nutrients.
The production of new living tissue.
The normal life span of plant cells is one to three years.
Stems have cells called meristems that annually generate new living tissue.
Specialist rank insignia (U.S.
Army) Specialist (abbreviated "SPC") is one of the four junior enlisted ranks in the U.S.
Army , just above Private First Class and equivalent in pay grade to Corporal .
Unlike Corporals, Specialists are not considered junior non-commissioned officers (NCOs).
A neuron ( or ; also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.
A chemical signal occurs via a synapse , a specialized connection with other cells.
Neurons connect to each other to form neural networks .
Neurons are the core components of the nervous system , which includes the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral ganglia .
A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain.
Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord, cause muscle contractions , and affect glands .
Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.
A typical neuron possesses a cell body (often called the soma ), dendrites , and an axon .
Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex "dendritic tree".
An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species.
The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates.
At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another.
There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: neurons that lack dendrites, neurons that have no axon, synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite, etc.
All neurons are electrically excitable, maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps , which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular- versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium , potassium , chloride , and calcium .
Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage- dependent ion channels .
If the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated, which travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives.
Neurons do not undergo cell division .
In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells .
Astrocytes , a type of glial cell , have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency . In humans, neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb , there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons.
The term Church of Christ may refer to: One of several New Testament designations for a local band of people following the teachings of Jesus, whom they believed to be the Christ ; only the plural form is found in the NT (e.g., Romans 16:16) Church bodies influenced by the Stone- Campbell Restoration Movement : Restoration Movement groups originating in Scotland and the U.S.

SpongeBob SquarePants (often referred to simply as SpongeBob) is an American animated television series, created by animator Stephen Hillenburg .
Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom.
The series' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise , contributing to its position as Nickelodeon 's highest rated show, the most distributed property of MTV Networks , and among Nicktoons' most watched shows.
It is listed 15th in IGN's top 100 animated series list.
When Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.
He teamed up with several Nickelodeon veterans and Rocko crew members, including creative director Derek Drymon ( Action League Now! , Hey Arnold! , and Rocko's Modern Life) writers and directors Sherm Cohen , and Dan Povenmire , writer Tim Hill , actor and writer Martin Olson , animation director Alan Smart (all from Rocko's Modern Life), and story editor Merriwether Williams ( The Angry Beavers ), who worked on the series for its first few seasons and switched to SpongeBob SquarePants in July 1999. To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on Rocko's Modern Life.
Steve described SpongeBob to me as childlike and naïve," Kenny said in an interview. 0 Q1416 when did spongebob first air D1349 SpongeBob SquarePants D1349- 8 "He’s not quite an adult, he’s not quite a kid. 0 Q1416 when did spongebob first air D1349 SpongeBob SquarePants D1349- 9 Think a Stan Laurel, Jerry Lewis kind of child-man. 0 Q1416 when did spongebob first air D1349 SpongeBob SquarePants D1349- 10 Kind of like a Munchkin but not quite, kind of like a kid, but not in a Charlie Brown child’s voice on the TV shows.
Originally, SpongeBob was to be named SpongeBoy, but this name was already in use.
This was discovered after voice-acting for the original seven-minute pilot was recorded in 1997.
The Nickelodeon legal department discovered that the name was already in use for a mop product.
Upon finding this out, Hillenburg decided that the character's given name still had to contain "Sponge" so viewers would not mistake the character for a "Cheese Man".
Hillenburg decided to use the name "SpongeBob".
He chose "SquarePants" as a family name as it referred to the character's square shape and it had a "nice ring to it".
The pilot episode of SpongeBob SquarePants first aired in the United States on Nickelodeon on May 1, 1999, following the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards .
The first episodes were called " Help Wanted ", "Reef Blower", and " Tea at the Treedome ".
The "official" series premiere followed on July 17, 1999, with the second episode, "Bubblestand/Ripped Pants." The show reached enormous popularity by 2000 during the second season, and has remained popular since.
A feature film of the series was released in theaters on November 19, 2004, with a sequel in development and slated for release in late-2014.
The series celebrated its tenth anniversary on July 17, 2009.
So far the series has aired 334 individual episodes.
It is currently Nickelodeon's longest- running cartoon, and currently in its ninth season .
SpongeBob surpassed Rugrats (in terms of number of episodes) when SpongeBob aired its 173rd episode on April 11, 2012 (while Rugrats had 172 episodes).
On April 12, 2012, SpongeBob aired its 174th episode and has produced 204 episodes, and more episodes will be produced, marking it as the first Nicktoon to have 200 or more episodes.
On July 21, 2012, SpongeBob was renewed and aired its ninth season .
This is the first SpongeBob season to have regular episodes produced in widescreen.
Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O. or DO) is a professional doctoral degree for physicians offered by medical schools in the United States .  Holders of the D.O. degree are known as osteopathic physicians and have the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as physicians with a Doctor of Medicine degree (M.D.).
D.O. physicians are licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in all 50 states, and make up 7 percent of the total U.S. physician population.
There are over 77,784 D.O. physicians in the United States, of which 69,429 are in active practice.
Currently, there are 29 medical schools with 37 locations throughout the United States that offer the D.O. degree, and 141 medical schools that offer the M.D. degree. As of 2011, 1 in 5 medical students in the United States were D.O. students.
The curricula at osteopathic medical schools are very similar to those at M.D.-granting medical schools .
Four years in total length, the first two years of medical school focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences, followed by two years of core clinical training in the clinical specialties.
One notable difference in the education at D.O.-granting medical schools is the inclusion of 300 – 500 additional hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system .
This training, referred to as osteopathic manipulative medicine , is absent in the M.D. curricula.
Upon graduation from medical school, osteopathic physicians enter internship or residency training programs, which may be followed by fellowship training .
Many D.O. physicians attend the same graduate medical education programs as their M.D. counterparts, and then take M.D. specialty board exams, while other D.O. graduates enter osteopathic programs and take D.O. specialty board examinations.
However, as of June 2015, all post- graduate training for both D.O. and M.D. physicians will be accredited by the ACGME . Active learning is an umbrella term that refers to several models of instruction that focus the responsibility of learning on learners.
Bonwell and Eison (1991) popularized this approach to instruction .
This "buzz word" of the 1980s became their 1990s report to the Association for the Study of Higher Education (ASHE). In this report they discuss a variety of methodologies for promoting "active learning".
They cite literature which indicates that to learn, students must do more than just listen: They must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems.
In particular, students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
A balanced budget (particularly that of a government) is a budget with revenues equal to expenditures , and neither a budget deficit nor a budget surplus ("the accounts balance").
More generally, it refers to a budget with no deficit, but possibly with a surplus.
A cyclically balanced budget is a budget that is not necessarily balanced year-to- year, but is balanced over the economic cycle , running a surplus in boom years and running a deficit in lean years, with these offsetting over time.  Balanced budgets, and the associated topic of budget deficits, are a contentious point within academic economics and within politics.
The mainstream economic view is that having a balanced budget in every year is not desirable, with budget deficits in lean times being desirable.

Finally in 1800 he became the first American to successfully roll copper into sheets for use as sheathing on naval vessels.

John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK, was the 35th President of the United States , serving from 1961 until his death in 1963.
After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific , Kennedy represented Massachusetts' 11th congressional district in the U.S.
House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat . Thereafter, he served in the U.S.
Senate from 1953 until 1960.
Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election .
At 43 years of age, he is the youngest to have been elected to the office, the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt ), and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president.
A Catholic , Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president, and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize .
Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the building of the Berlin Wall , the Space Race , the African- American Civil Rights Movement , and early stages of the Vietnam War .
Therein, Kennedy increased the number of military advisers, special operation forces, and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia.
The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government.
It involved certain forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents.
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas , Texas.
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later, before a trial could take place.
The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin.
However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy .
However, ABC News in their investigation, The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy, confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission; having concluded Oswald acted alone.
Kennedy's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970.
Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light.
Details of Kennedy's health problems in which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s.

A monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually or nominally embodied in a single individual (the monarch ).
King Solomon 's royal court. Forms of monarchy differ widely based on the level of legal autonomy the monarch holds in governance, the method of selection of the monarch, and any predetermined limits on the length of their tenure.
When the monarch has no or few legal restraints in state and political matters, it is called an absolute monarchy and is a form of autocracy .
Cases in which the monarch's discretion is formally limited (most common today) are called constitutional monarchies .
In hereditary monarchies , the office is passed through inheritance within a family group, whereas elective monarchies are selected by some system of voting.
Historically these systems are most commonly combined, either formally or informally, in some manner. (For instance, in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are considered eligible, whereas many hereditary monarchies have legal requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors that act both as de facto elections and to create situations of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election.) Finally, there are situations in which the expiration of a monarch’s reign is set based either on the calendar or on the achievement of certain goals (repulse of invasion, for instance.) The effect of historical and geographic difference along each of these three axes is to create widely divergent structures and traditions defining “monarchy.” King Leopold I , an elected founder of the hereditary monarchy of Belgium .
Monarchy was the most common form of government into the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent, at least at the national level.
Where it exists, it now often takes the form of constitutional monarchy , in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no political power pursuant to a constitution or tradition which allocates governing authority elsewhere.
Currently, 44 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 16 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognize Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state.
All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City , but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger.
The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia and Morocco "reign, but do not rule" although there is considerable variation in the amount of authority they wield.  Although they reign under constitutions, the monarchs of Brunei , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and Swaziland appear to continue to exercise more political influence than any other single source of authority in their nations, either by constitutional mandate or by tradition.
Per diem ( Latin for "per day" or "for each day") is a daily allowance for expenses, a specific amount of money that an organization gives an individual per day to cover living and traveling expenses (allowance) in connection with work done away from home or on tour.
Per diem is also used as an adjective and an adverb.
Per diem pay eliminates the need for employees to spend as much time creating expense reports documenting the amount spent while traveling on business for reimbursement.
Instead, employers pay employees a standard daily rate without regard to the amount actually spent by the employee.
Employees do not have to give back any money if they did not use all of the per diem for travel expenses.
Robin Hood statue in Nottingham Robin Hood (spelled Robyn Hode in older manuscripts) is an heroic outlaw in English folklore , a highly skilled archer and swordsman . Although not part of his original character, since the beginning of the 19th century he has become known for "robbing from the rich and giving to the poor", assisted by a group of fellow outlaws known as his " Merry Men ".
Traditionally, Robin Hood and his men are depicted wearing Lincoln green clothes.
The origin of the legend is claimed by some to have stemmed from actual outlaws, or from ballads or tales of outlaws.
Robin Hood became a popular folk figure in the medieval period continuing through to modern literature, films and television.
In the earliest sources, Robin Hood is a yeoman , but he was often later portrayed as an aristocrat wrongfully dispossessed of his lands and made into an outlaw by an unscrupulous sheriff.

John Herschel Glenn, Jr. (born July 18, 1921) is a retired United States Marine Corps pilot , astronaut , and United States senator .
He was the first American to orbit the Earth and the fifth person in space, after cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov and fellow Mercury Seven astrononauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom.
Glenn was a combat aviator in the Marine Corps and one of the Mercury Seven , who were the elite U.S. military test pilots selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to operate the experimental Mercury spacecraft and become the first American astronauts.
He flew the Friendship 7 mission on February 20, 1962.
In 1965, Glenn retired from the military and resigned from NASA so he could be eligible to stand for election to public office.
As a member of the Democratic Party he was elected to represent Ohio in the U.S.
Senate from 1974 to 1999.
Glenn received a Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.
He was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990.
On October 29, 1998, he became the oldest person to fly in space, and the only one to fly in both the Mercury and Space Shuttle programs , when at age 77, he flew on Discovery ( STS-95 ).
Glenn and Scott Carpenter are the last living members of the Mercury Seven .

Diagnosis-related group (DRG) is a system to classify hospital cases into one of originally 467 groups.
The 467th group was "Ungroupable".
This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by Robert B Fetter, PhD, of the Yale School of Management, and John D Thompson, MPH, of the Yale School of Public Health.
The system is also referred to as "the DRGs", and its intent was to identify the "products" that a hospital provides.
One example of a "product" is an appendectomy.
The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement, to replace "cost based" reimbursement that had been used up to that point.
DRGs are assigned by a "grouper" program based on ICD (International Classification of Diseases) diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, discharge status, and the presence of complications or comorbidities . DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital for each "product", since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources.
DRGs may be further grouped into Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs).
DRGs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other Medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers.
Deliverable is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer (either internal or external).
A deliverable could be a report, a document, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project.
A deliverable may be composed of multiple smaller deliverables.
It may be either an outcome to be achieved (as in "The corporation says that becoming profitable this year is a deliverable.") or an output to be provided (as in "The deliverable for the completed project consists of a special-purpose electronic device and its controlling software.").
A deliverable differs from a project milestone in that a milestone is a measurement of progress toward an output whereas the deliverable is the result of the process.
For a typical project, a milestone might be the completion of a product design while the deliverable might be the technical diagram of the product.
A deliverable also differs from a project document in that project document is typically part of a project deliverable, or a project deliverable may contain number of documents and physical things.
In technical projects, deliverables can further be classified as hardware , software , or design documents .
In contracted efforts, deliverable may refer to an item specifically required by contract documents, such as an item on a Contract Data Requirements List or mentioned in the Statement Of Work .
Jefferson Finis Davis (June 3, 1808 – December 6, 1889) was an American statesman and leader of the Confederacy during the American Civil War , serving as President of the Confederate States of America for its entire history, from 1861 to 1865.
Davis was born in Kentucky to Samuel and Jane (Cook) Davis.
After attending Transylvania University , Davis graduated from West Point and fought in the Mexican–American War as the colonel of a volunteer regiment named the Mississippi Rifles .
He served as the United States Secretary of War under Democratic President Franklin Pierce .
Both before and after his time in the Pierce administration, he served as a Democratic U.S. senator representing the state of Mississippi .
As a senator, he argued against secession , but did agree that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union.
On February 9, 1861, after Davis resigned from the United States Senate, he was selected to be the provisional President of the Confederate States of America; he was elected without opposition to a six-year term that November.
During his presidency, Davis took charge of the Confederate war plans but was unable to find a strategy to stop the larger, more powerful and better organized Union .
His diplomatic efforts failed to gain recognition from any foreign country, and he paid little attention to the collapsing Confederate economy, printing more and more paper money to cover the war's expenses. Historians have criticized Davis for being a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln , which they attribute to Davis being overbearing, controlling, and overly meddlesome, as well as being out of touch with public opinion, and lacking support from a political party (since the Confederacy had no political parties).
His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors, inability to get along with people who disagreed with him, and neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones all worked against him.
After Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, he was charged with treason .
Although he was not tried, he was stripped of his eligibility to run for public office; Congress posthumously lifted this restriction in 1978, 89 years after his death.
While not disgraced, he was displaced in Southern affection after the war by the leading Confederate general, Robert E.
Lee .
However, many Southerners empathized with his defiance, refusal to accept defeat, and resistance to Reconstruction .
Over time, admiration for his pride and ideals made him a Civil War hero to many Southerners, and his legacy became part of the foundation of the postwar New South .
By the late 1880s, Davis began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union.
He was aided in the last decade of his life by the generosity of Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey , a wealthy widow.
First she invited him to her plantation near Biloxi, Mississippi , in 1877, at a time when he was ailing, and gave him a cottage to use for working on his memoirs.
She bequeathed Davis her plantation upon her death in 1878, as well as additional funds for his support.
This enabled him to live in some comfort with his wife until his death in 1889.
Though heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, this residence was reconstructed and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark ; it is known as Beauvoir and is a popular tourist attraction in the Biloxi area.

A googol is the large number 10100; that is, the digit 1 followed by 100 zeroes : 1,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​‐ 000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​‐ 000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​‐ 000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000.
The term was coined in 1938 by 9-year- old Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner .
Kasner popularized the concept in his 1940 book Mathematics and the Imagination . Other names for googol include ten duotrigintillion on the short scale , ten thousand sexdecillion on the long scale , or ten sexdecilliard on the Peletier long scale .
A googol has no particular significance in mathematics, but is useful when comparing with other very large quantities such as the number of subatomic particles in the visible universe or the number of hypothetically possible chess games.
Edward Kasner used it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and infinity , and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics.
A googol is approximately 70! ( factorial of 70).
In the binary numeral system , one would need 333 bits to represent a googol, i.e., 1 googol ≈ 2332.19, or exactly .
This number is notable for being the subject of the £1 million question in the infamous episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? , when contestant Charles Ingram cheated his way through the show by getting help from his wife Diana, who was in the audience, and fellow contestant Tecwen Whittock.
It is also the namesake of the internet company Google , with the name "Google" being a misspelling of "googol" by the company's founders. 1 Googol (1E100) is a small fraction more, than the biggest number a usual hand-held calculator can display and handle, which is 9.999... 69!

The Juris Doctor (J.D.) is a professional doctorate and first professional graduate degree in law .
The degree is earned by completing law school in the United States or other common law countries.  Those who hold the degree of Juris Doctor are professionals committed to the practice of law , and they are primarily concerned with ensuring that laws are upheld and followed in a variety of circumstances.
They may focus their practice on criminal law , personal injury , family law , corporate law , or a wide range of other areas.
Most individuals holding a Juris Doctorate must pass an exam to be licensed to practice law within their jurisdiction .
Professionals holding this degree are known as lawyers or attorneys , and they are designated by the suffix esquire (Esq.).
The degree was first awarded by Harvard University in the United States in the late 19th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree (such as the Dottore in Giurisprudenza in Italy and the Juris Utriusque Doctor in Germany and Central Europe).
Originating from the 19th century Harvard movement for the scientific study of law , it is a law degree that in most common law jurisdictions is the primary professional preparation for lawyers.
It is a three-year program in most jurisdictions.
The menstrual cycle is the scientific term for the physiological changes that occur in fertile women and other female primates for the purposes of sexual reproduction . This article focuses on the human menstrual cycle, a "monthly" cycle that can vary around an average of ~28 days per cycle.
The menstrual cycle, under the control of the endocrine system , is necessary for reproduction .
It is commonly divided into three phases: the follicular phase , ovulation , and the luteal phase .
It is also occasionally misclassified using the uterine cycle: menstruation , proliferative phase, and secretory phase.
Menstrual cycles are counted from the first day of menstrual bleeding.
Hormonal contraception interferes with the normal hormonal changes with the aim of preventing reproduction.
Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) slow then stop, and the lining of the uterus thickens.
Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles atrophy and die).
Approximately mid-cycle, 24–36 hours after the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an ovum, or egg in an event called ovulation.
After ovulation, the egg only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum ; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone .  Under the influence of progesterone, the endometrium (uterine lining) changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy .
If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing sharp drops in levels of both progesterone and estrogen.
These hormone drops cause the uterus to shed its lining and egg in a process termed menstruation.
In the menstrual cycle, changes occur in the female reproductive system as well as other systems (which lead to breast tenderness or mood changes, for example).
A woman's first menstruation is termed menarche , and occurs typically around age 12-13.
The end of a woman's reproductive phase is called the menopause , which commonly occurs somewhere between the ages of 45 and 55.
The Big Sandy River at its confluence with the Ohio River.
The land in the foreground is West Virginia, that on the left is Kentucky, while the background is Ohio.
The Big Sandy River is a tributary of the Ohio River , approximately long, in western West Virginia and northeastern Kentucky in the United States .
The river forms part of the boundary between the two states along its entire course.
Via the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed .
It is formed between Louisa, Kentucky , and Fort Gay, West Virginia , by the confluence of the Tug Fork and Levisa Fork .
It flows generally northwardly in a highly meandering course, between Lawrence and Boyd counties in Kentucky and Wayne County in West Virginia.
It joins the Ohio between Catlettsburg, Kentucky and Kenova, West Virginia , west of Huntington, West Virginia , at the common boundary between West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio .
The river is navigable and carries commercial shipping, primarily coal mined in the immediate region.
The name of the river comes from the presence of extensive sand bars.
The Native American names for the river included Tatteroa, Chatteroi, and Chatterwha which had similar meaning to the English name. It was known to the Lenape as Sikeacepe, meaning "Salt River", from the presence of salt licks on the river (see: Licking River ).
Two well-known fiddle tunes take their name from the Big Sandy River: "Sandy River Belle" and the "Big Sandy River".
Loretta Lynn 's "Van Lear Rose" also mentions the river.

The film was directed by Renny Harlin and was released in the United States on July 28, 1999.
The music of Star Wars consists of the scores written for all six Star Wars films by composer John Williams from 1977 to 1983 for the Original Trilogy , and 1999 to 2005 for the Prequel Trilogy .
Williams' scores for the double trilogy count among the most widely known and popular contributions to modern film music .
Additionally, music for Star Wars: The Clone Wars was written by Kevin Kiner, and further music has been composed for Star Wars video games and works in other media. The scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Korngold and Max Steiner .
While several obvious nods to Gustav Holst , William Walton and Igor Stravinsky exist in the score to Episode IV , Williams relied less and less on classical references in the latter five scores, incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score.
The reasons for Williams' tapping of a familiar Romantic idiom are known to involve Lucas' desire to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known, audience-accessible music.
Indeed, Lucas maintains much of the trilogy's success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters and, importantly, music.
Star Wars often is credited as heralding the beginning of a revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s.
One technique in particular is an influence: Williams's revival of a technique called leitmotif , which is most famously associated with the operas of Richard Wagner and, in film scores, with Steiner.
A leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character, place, plot element, mood, idea, relationship or other specific part of the film.
It commonly is used in modern film scoring as a device for mentally anchoring certain parts of a film to the soundtrack.
Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development.
A series of concerts which featured Star Wars music, Star Wars: In Concert , took place in 2009 and 2010.
First performed in London , it went on to tour across the United States and Canada , last playing at London, Ontario, Canada on July 25, 2010.
Adderall is a psychostimulant medication that contains amphetamine , used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy .
Adderall is a combination of four amphetamine salts ( racemic amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , racemic amphetamine sulfate , dextroamphetamine saccharide , and dextroamphetamine sulfate ).
It is a dopamine releasing agent , a norepinephrine releasing agent , and can be mildly serotonergic .
It is available in two formulations: IR (Instant Release) and XR (Extended Release).
The immediate release formulation is indicated for use in ADHD and narcolepsy, while the XR formulation is approved for use only with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Important side effects of therapeutic dextroamphetamine include stunted growth in young people and occasionally a psychotic episode can occur at therapeutic doses during chronic therapy as a treatment emergent side effect.
When abused at high doses, the risk of experiencing side effects and the severity of side effects increases.
Side effects may include sweating or shaking.
Like other stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine and cocaine , Adderall directly affects the mesolimbic reward pathway in the brain.
Amphetamine salt preparations are considered to have high abuse potential, and it is classified as Schedule II by the US DEA . With the Safe Streets and Communities Act in Canada, Adderall has been reclassified from Schedule III to Schedule I.
Alpine ski slope Alpine skiing is the sport of sliding down snow -covered hills on skis with fixed- heel bindings .
It is also commonly known as downhill skiing, although that also incorporates different styles.
Alpine skiing can be contrasted with skiing using free-heel bindings; ski mountaineering and nordic skiing – such as cross-country ; ski jumping ; and Telemark .
Alpine skiing is popular wherever the combination of snow, mountain slopes, and a sufficient tourist infrastructure can be built up, including parts of Europe , North America , Australia and New Zealand , the South American Andes , and East Asia .
Alpine skiing began as a club sport 1861 at Kiandra in Australia and a number of similar clubs in North America and the Austrian and Swiss Alps.
Today, most alpine skiing occurs at a ski resort with ski lifts that transport skiers up the mountain.
The snow is groomed, avalanches are controlled and trees are cut to create trails.
Many resorts also include snow making equipment to provide skiing when the weather would otherwise not allow it.
Alternatively, alpine skiers may pursue the sport in less controlled environments; this practice is variously referred to as ski touring , backcountry skiing , or extreme skiing .
In competitive alpine skiing races four disciplines exist: slalom , giant slalom , super giant slalom , and downhill .
Slalom ski races have courses that require short tight turns, whereas giant- slalom races have courses which are set with more widely spaced turns.
Super-giant slalom and downhill have few turns, the courses have gates spaced widely apart and skiers often reach 100 km/h.

Hamilton Co. of Washington, D.C.
Shampoo () is a hair care product used for the removal of oils , dirt , skin particles, dandruff , environmental pollutants and other contaminant particles that gradually build up in hair .
The goal is to remove the unwanted build-up without stripping out so much sebum as to make hair unmanageable.
Even though most modern shampoos include a conditioning component, conditioner is used to smooth and detangle hair that has been washed with shampoo first.

Malaysia ( or ) is a federal constitutional monarchy in Southeast Asia . It consists of thirteen states and three federal territories and has a total landmass of separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized regions, Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo .
Land borders are shared with Thailand , Indonesia , and Brunei , and maritime borders exist with Singapore , Vietnam , and the Philippines .
The capital city is Kuala Lumpur , while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government.
In 2010 the population was 28.33 million, with 22.6 million living on the Peninsula.
Malaysia has its origins in the Malay Kingdoms present in the area which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British Empire .
The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements , whose establishment was followed by the Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates.
The territories on Peninsular Malaysia were first unified as the Malayan Union in 1946.
Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948, and achieved independence on 31 August 1957.
Malaya united with Sabah , Sarawak , and Singapore on 16 September 1963, with si being added to give the new country the name Malaysia.
Less than two years later in 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation.
Since independence, Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia, with GDP growing an average 6.5% for almost 50 years.
The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources, but is expanding in the sectors of science, tourism, commerce and medical tourism .
The country is multi-ethnic and multi- cultural , which plays a large role in politics.
The constitution declares Islam the state religion while protecting freedom of religion.
The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and the legal system is based on English Common Law .
The head of state is the King, known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong .
He is an elected monarch chosen from the hereditary rulers of the nine Malay states every five years.
The head of government is the Prime Minister .
Malaysia contains the southernmost point of continental Eurasia , Tanjung Piai .
Located in the tropics , it is a megadiverse country , with large numbers of endemic animals, fungi and plants .
It is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the East Asia Summit and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and a member of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , and the Non-Aligned Movement .
Adolf Hitler (; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian -born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party ( (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party).
He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Führer und Reichskanzler ) from 1934 to 1945.
Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe , and the Holocaust .
Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I . He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921.
In 1923, he attempted a coup d'état in Munich, known as the Beer Hall Putsch . The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle).
After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan- Germanism , antisemitism , and anti- communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda .
After his appointment as chancellor in 1933, he transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich , a single- party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism.
Hitler's aim was to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in continental Europe.
To this end, his foreign and domestic policies had the aim of seizing Lebensraum ("living space") for the Germanic people .
He directed the rearmament of Germany and the invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht in September 1939, resulting in the outbreak of World War II in Europe .
Under Hitler's rule, in 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa .
In 1943, Germany had been forced onto the defensive and suffered a series of escalating defeats.
In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time partner, Eva Braun .
On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army , and their corpses were burned.
Hitler's aggressive foreign policy is considered the main cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe.
His antisemitic policies and racially motivated ideology resulted in the deaths of at least 5.5 million Jews , and millions of other people deemed racially inferior .
Swedish grocery store where private label products (under the brands ' and Eldorado , Axfood ) are placed along with other brands such as Knorr ( Unilever ) and ' ( Campbell Soup ).
Private label products or services are typically those manufactured or provided by one company for offer under another company's brand .
Private label goods and services are available in a wide range of industries from food to cosmetics to web hosting.
They are often positioned as lower cost alternatives to regional, national or international brands, although recently some private label brands have been positioned as "premium" brands to compete with existing "name" brands.
Richelieu Foods , for example, is a private label company producing frozen pizza, salad dressing, sauces, marinades, condiments and deli salads for other companies, including Hy-Vee , Aldi , Save-A-Lot , Sam's Club , Hannaford Brothers Co. , BJ's Wholesale Club (Earth's Pride brand) and Shaw's Supermarkets (Culinary Circle brand).
Another prominent example is the Cott Corporation , which manufactures private-label beverages for many supermarket chains.
McBride plc is an example of a European based provider of private label household and personal care products.

A founder of Journal of Negro History , Woodson has been cited as the father of black history .
Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 – June 10, 2004) was an American musician known as Ray Charles (to avoid confusion with champion boxer Sugar Ray Robinson ).
He was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm and blues , gospel , and blues styles into his early recordings with Atlantic Records .
He also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records , most notably with his Modern Sounds albums.
While with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company.
Frank Sinatra called Charles “the only true genius in show business,” although Charles downplayed this notion.
The influences upon his music were mainly jazz, blues, rhythm and blues and country artists of the day such as Art Tatum , Nat King Cole , Louis Jordan , Charles Brown , Louis Armstrong .
His playing reflected influences from country blues , barrelhouse and stride piano styles.
Rolling Stone ranked Charles number ten on their list of "100 Greatest Artists of All Time" in 2004, and number two on their November 2008 list of "100 Greatest Singers of All Time".
In honoring Charles, Billy Joel noted: "This may sound like sacrilege , but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley .

Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax () is a United States Federal payroll (or employment) tax imposed on both employees and employers to fund Social Security and Medicare —federal programs that provide benefits for retirees, the disabled, and children of deceased workers.
Social Security benefits include old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI); Medicare provides hospital insurance benefits for the elderly.
The amount that one pays in payroll taxes throughout one's working career is associated indirectly with the social security benefits annuity that one receives as a retiree.
This has caused some to claim that the payroll tax is not a tax because its collection is tied to a benefit.
The United States Supreme Court decided in Flemming v.
Nestor (1960) that no one has an accrued property right to benefits from Social Security.
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act is currently codified at Title 26 , Subtitle C, Chapter 21 of the United States Code .
A college football national championship in the highest level of collegiate play in the United States, currently the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), is a designation awarded annually by various third-party organizations to their selection(s) of the best college football team(s).
Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) football is the only NCAA sport in which a yearly champion is not determined by an NCAA sanctioned championship event.
Because the championship team is not determined by a NCAA championship or tournament event, it is sometimes unofficially referred to as a " mythical national championship ". Since the NCAA, the sport's governing body, does not determine or declare a national champion in this field, determination of such has often engendered controversy.
A championship team is independently declared by various individuals and organizations, often referred to as "selectors".
These choices are sometimes at odds with each other.
While the NCAA has never officially endorsed an annual championship team, it has documented the choices of several selectors in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records.
In addition, various third party analysts have independently published their own lists of what they have determined to be the most legitimate selections for each season.
These are also often at odds with each other as well as individual school's claims on national championships, which, for any particular season, may or may not correlate to the selections published elsewhere.
Currently, two widely recognized national champions selectors are the Associated Press , which conducts a poll of football sportswriters , and the USA Today Coaches' Poll , a poll of American Football Coaches Association active coaches that is contractually obligated to name the winner of the Bowl Championship Series championship game as its national champion.

The Duomo of Milan .
Duomo is a term for a cathedral church.
The formal word for a church that is currently a cathedral is cattedrale; a Duomo may be either a present or a former cathedral (the latter always in a town that no longer has a bishop nor therefore a cathedral, as for example Trevi ).
Some, like the Duomo of Monza , have never been cathedrals, although old and important.
Many people refer to particular churches simply as "Il Duomo" or "The Duomo", without regard to the full proper name of the church.
Similar words exist in other languages: Dom (German), Dóm (Hungarian & Slovakian), Dôme (French), Domkirke (Danish), Dómkirkja (Icelandic),Domo (Portuguese) Domkyrka (Swedish), Domkirke (Norwegian), Doms (Latvian), Toomkirik (Estonian), Tum (Polish), and Tuomiokirkko (Finnish).
Also in these languages the respective terms do not necessarily refer to a church functioning as a cathedral, but also to proto-cathedrals or simply prominent church buildings, which have never been a cathedral in the exact sense of that word.
In German the term Dom became the synecdoche , used - pars pro toto - for most existing or former collegiate churches .
Therefore the uniform translation of these terms into English as cathedrals may not always be appropriate and should be used on a contextual basis.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , and to Lo Zingarelli , the word derives from the Latin word "", meaning house, as a cathedral is the "house of God", or domus Dei.
The Garzanti online dictionary also gives the etymology as deriving from house, but house of the bishop ("domu(m) (episcopi); 'casa (del vescovo)') instead of the house of God. Italian cathedrals are often highly decorated and contain notable artworks; in many cases the buildings themselves are true artworks.
Perhaps the best known Duomo is Milan Cathedral , but other well-known cathedrals include San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome and those of Alba , Ancona , Mantua , Parma and Florence 's Santa Maria del Fiore .
Other notable examples are in Cefalù , Cremona , Enna , L'Aquila , Modena , Monreale , Naples , Genoa , Orvieto , Padua , Piazza Armerina , Pisa (the Leaning Tower is the Duomo's bell- tower), Prato , San Gimignano , Siena , Spoleto , Turin and Viterbo .
The Battle of Ager Sanguinis , 1337 miniature  The Crusades were a series of wars taking place in Asia Minor and the Levant between 1095 and 1291, in which Western European nations engaged using the propaganda of religious expeditionary wars .
The first crusade was called by Pope Urban II of the Roman Catholic Church , with the stated goal of restoring Christian access to the holy places in and near Jerusalem .
The background to the Crusades was the centuries of Arab–Byzantine Wars and the Seljuq-Byzantine Wars and the recent decisive defeat of the Byzantine army by Seljuk Turks at Manzikert in 1071.
The Norman conqueror Robert Guiscard 's conquest of Byzantine territories added to the problems of the Byzantine Empire.
In an attempt to curtail both dangers, its Emperor Alexios I sought to align Christian nations against a common enemy, requested western aid, and Pope Urban II in turn enlisted western leaders in the cause of taking back the Holy Land .
The crusaders comprised military units of Roman Catholics from all over western Europe, and were not under unified command.
The main series of Crusades, primarily against Muslims in the Levant , occurred between 1095 and 1291.
Historians have given many of the earlier crusades numbers.
After some early successes, the later crusades failed and the crusaders were defeated and forced to return home.
Several hundred thousand soldiers became Crusaders by taking vows; the Pope granted them plenary indulgence .
Their emblem was the cross — the term "crusade" is derived from the French term for taking up the cross.
Many were from France and called themselves " Franks ," which became the common term used by Muslims.
Europeans had historically called the occupants of the Holy Land Saracens , and used this in a negative sense throughout the Crusades and often into European history books into the 20th century.
The term "crusade" is also used to describe religiously motivated campaigns conducted between 1100 and 1600 in territories outside the Levant usually against pagans, heretics, and peoples under the ban of excommunication for a mixture of religious, economic, and political reasons.
Rivalries among both Christian and Muslim powers led also to alliances between religious factions against their opponents, such as the Christian alliance with the Islamic Sultanate of Rûm during the Fifth Crusade .
The Crusades had major political, economic, and social impact on western Europe.
It resulted in a substantial weakening of the Christian Byzantine Empire , which fell several centuries later to the Muslim Turks . The Reconquista , a long period of wars in Spain and Portugal ( Iberia ), where Christian forces reconquered the peninsula from Muslims, is closely tied to the Crusades.

The system of imperial units or the imperial system (also known as British Imperial) is the system of units first defined in the British Weights and Measures Act of 1824, which was later refined and reduced.
The system came into official use across the British Empire .
By the late 20th century, most nations of the former empire had officially adopted the metric system as their main system of measurement, although as of 2013 the United Kingdom had only partially adopted it.

For the psychological concept, see Generativity vs.
Stagnation .
Midlife crisis is a term coined in 1965 by Elliott Jaques stating a time where adults come to realize their own mortality and how much time is left in their life.
A midlife crisis is experienced by many people during the midlife transition when they realize that life may be more than halfway over.
Sometimes, a crisis can be triggered by transitions experienced in these years, such as andropause or menopause , the death of parents or other causes of grief , unemployment or underemployment, realizing that a job or career is hated but not knowing how else to earn an equivalent living, or children leaving home .
People may reassess their achievements in terms of their dreams.
The result may be a desire to make significant changes in core aspects of day-to-day life or situation, such as in career, work-life balance , marriage, romantic relationships, large expenditures, or physical appearance.

The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly called the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a federal republic consisting of fifty states and a federal district .
The lower forty-eight contiguous states and the federal district of Washington, D.C. are in central North America between Canada and Mexico.
The state of Alaska is west of Canada and east of Russia across the Bering Strait, and the state of Hawaii is in the mid-North Pacific.
The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean.
At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) and with around 315 million people, the United States is the third- or fourth-largest country by total area and the third-largest by both land area and population .
It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries . The geography and climate of the U.S. is also extremely diverse, with deserts, plains, forests, and mountains that are home to a wide variety of species.
Paleoindians migrated from Asia to what is now the United States mainland around 15,000 years ago.
After 1500, Old World diseases introduced by Europeans greatly reduced their populations.
European colonization began around 1600 and came mostly from England.
The United States emerged from thirteen British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard.
Disputes between Great Britain and the American colonies led to the American Revolution .
On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence , which established the United States of America.
The American Revolutionary War , which ended with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain , was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire .
The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; twenty-seven Amendments have since been added to the Constitution.
The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights , were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms .
Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny , the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century.
This involved displacing native tribes , acquiring new territories , and gradually admitting new states.
The American Civil War ended legalized slavery in the United States.
By the end of the nineteenth century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest.
The Spanish–American War and confirmed the country's status as a global military power.
The United States emerged from as a global superpower , the first country with nuclear weapons , and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.
The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated 2012 GDP of $15.6 trillion 19% of global GDP at purchasing-power parity , as of 2011.
The per capita GDP of the U.S. was the world's sixth-highest as of 2010, although America's wealth inequality was also ranked highest among OECD countries by the World Bank .
The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity; and while its economy is considered post- industrial it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.
The country accounts for 39% of global military spending , and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world, as well as a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.
In astronomy, the circumpolar constellations are constellations that never set from the viewer's perspective.
Considered a very important effect in astronomy, it is different from seasonal constellations .
Circumpolar constellations stay in the sky.
Because of the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the Sun, we divide the stars and constellations into two groups.
Some stars and constellations never rise nor set, and they are called circumpolar.
All the rest are divided into seasonal stars and constellations.
Which stars and constellations will be circumpolar and which seasonal depends on your latitude. In the northern hemisphere, we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the northern circumpolar sky, while in the southern hemisphere, we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the southern circumpolar sky.
The celestial north pole, currently marked by Polaris , always has an azimuth equal to zero.
Also, its altitude for a given place is fixed and its value is given by the following formula: A = 90-Ø.
All stars with a declination less than A are not circumpolar.
They are also visible year round at that location.
From the North Pole , all constellations north of the celestial equator , (all fully visible constellations) are circumpolar, and similarly from the South Pole .
From the equator , there are no circumpolar constellations.
From mid-north latitudes (40–50°N), circumpolar constellations may include Ursa Major , Ursa Minor , Draco , Cepheus , Cassiopeia and the not well known Camelopardalis .
Cory in the House is an American television sitcom , which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin- off from the Disney show That's So Raven .
The show focuses on Cory Baxter , who moved from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. , after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef.
The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off.
This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show.
Reruns of the series no longer air on Disney Channel , or on Disney XD , but do air on the Family channel in Canada.
Raven-Symone guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode.
A typical paddleball paddle.
One Wall Paddleball is an American ball game that consists in hitting a small rubber ball against a single wall by using paddles .
It can be played in singles (1 versus 1) or in doubles (2 versus 2).
The general rule of the game is that the ball must hit the wall without touching the court floor more than once in order to be a valid rally .
The balls are usually of the colors black , blue , and green .
The paddles were originally made of wood , but they are now primarily made of materials such as graphite and titanium..
The Black Beauty paddle pictured on the right was actually designed by doubles champion, Chris Lecakes and manufactured by Nat Marks of MarCraft.
The original Black Beauty paddle remains in the possession of the Lecakes family.
The game is popular in places where the weather permits outdoor plays such as New York , Florida , New Jersey , Connecticut , California and Puerto Rico , although indoor courts, albeit rare, exist.
Tournaments are ruled by the American Paddleball Association .

Same-sex marriage is legally recognized in several jurisdictions within the United States.
As of May 2013, ten states— Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington —as well as the District of Columbia and three Native American tribes —have legalized same-sex marriage, representing 16.1% of the U.S. population.
In addition, California , which briefly granted same-sex marriages in 2008, now recognizes them on a conditional basis. While several jurisdictions have legalized same-sex marriage through court rulings, legislative action, and popular vote , nine states prohibit same-sex marriage by statute and 30 prohibit it in their constitutions .
The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), enacted in 1996, prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and allows each state to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other states.
The provision of DOMA forbidding the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages has been found unconstitutional in eight federal courts , including two federal appeals courts .
Five of these cases are pending review by the Supreme Court .
The movement to obtain marriage rights and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s, but became more prominent in U.S. politics in 1993 when the Hawaii Supreme Court declared the state's prohibition to be unconstitutional in Baehr v.
Lewin .
During the 21st century, public support for legalizing same-sex marriage has grown considerably, and various national polls conducted since 2011 show that a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage.
On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to publicly declare support for the legalization of same-sex marriage.
On November 6, 2012, Maine , Maryland , and Washington became the first states to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote.
Portrait by George Caleb Bingham Statue at Clinton County Courthouse in Missouri David Rice Atchison (August 11, 1807January 26, 1886) was a mid-19th century Democratic United States Senator from Missouri .
He served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate for six years.
He is best known for the claim that for one day (March 4, 1849) he may have been Acting President of the United States .
Atchison, owner of many slaves and a plantation, was a prominent pro-slavery activist and Border Ruffian leader, deeply involved with violence against abolitionists and other free-staters during the " Bleeding Kansas " events.
A Roth IRA ( Individual Retirement Arrangement ) is a special type of retirement plan under US law that is generally not taxed, provided certain conditions are met.
The tax law of the United States allows a tax reduction on a limited amount of saving for retirement.
The Roth IRA's principal difference from most other tax advantaged retirement plans is that, rather than granting a tax break for money placed into the plan, the tax break is granted on the money withdrawn from the plan during retirement.
A Roth IRA can be an individual retirement account containing investments in securities , usually common stocks and bonds , often through mutual funds (although other investments, including derivatives, notes, certificates of deposit , and real estate are possible).
A Roth IRA can also be an individual retirement annuity , which is an annuity contract or an endowment contract purchased from a life insurance company.
As with all IRAs, the Internal Revenue Service mandates specific eligibility and filing status requirements.
A Roth IRA's main advantages are its tax structure and the additional flexibility that this tax structure provides.
Also, there are fewer restrictions on the investments that can be made in the plan than many other tax advantaged plans, and this adds somewhat to the popularity, though the investment options available depend on the trustee (or the place where the plan is established). The total contributions allowed per year to all IRAs is the lesser of one's taxable compensation (which is not the same as adjusted gross income ) and the limit amounts as seen below (this total may be split up between any number of traditional and Roth IRAs. In the case of a married couple, each spouse may contribute the amount listed): For example, if one is single, aged 49 or under, and earns $10,000, one can contribute a maximum of $5,000 in 2008.
However, if one is single and earns $2,000, one can contribute only a maximum of $2,000 in 2008 ($2,000 is the lesser of $2,000 and $5,000). * Since 2009, contribution limits have been assessed for potential increases based on inflation, though the contribution limits for 2009 through 2012 remained unchanged.

Presynaptic terminal2.
Sarcolemma3 .
Synaptic vesicle4 .
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor5 .
Mitochondrion Neuromuscular-blocking drugs block neuromuscular transmission at the neuromuscular junction , causing paralysis of the affected skeletal muscles .
This is accomplished either by acting presynaptically via the inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis or release or by acting postsynaptically at the acetylcholine receptors of the motor nerve end-plate.
While some drugs act presynaptically (such as botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin ), those of current clinical importance work postsynaptically.
In clinical use, neuromuscular block is used adjunctively to anesthesia to produce paralysis , firstly to paralyse the vocal cords, and permit intubation of the trachea, and secondly to optimize the surgical field by inhibiting spontaneous ventilation, and causing relaxation of skeletal muscles. Because the appropriate dose of neuromuscular-blocking drug may paralyze muscles required for breathing (i.e., the diaphragm), mechanical ventilation should be available to maintain adequate respiration .
Patients are still aware of pain even after full conduction block has occurred; hence, general anesthetics and/or analgesics must also be given to prevent anesthesia awareness .
Quaternary ammonium muscle relaxants are quaternary ammonium salts used as drugs for muscle relaxation , most commonly in anesthesia .
It is necessary to prevent spontaneous movement of muscle during surgical operations .
Muscle relaxants inhibit neuron transmission to muscle by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor .
What they have in common, and is necessary for their effect, is the structural presence of quaternary ammonium groups, usually two.
Some of them are found in nature and others are synthesized molecules.
Washington crossing the Delaware, Dec. 25 1776, an iconic event of the American Revolution Storming of the Bastille, July 14, 1789, an iconic event of the French Revolution 1700 CE world map The 18th century lasted from January 1, 1701 to December 31, 1800 in the Gregorian calendar .
During the 18th century, the Enlightenment culminated in the French and American revolutions .
Philosophy and science increased in prominence.
Philosophers dreamed of a brighter age.
This dream turned into a reality with the French Revolution, although it was later compromised by excess of the terror of Maximilien Robespierre .
At first, the monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals, but with the French Revolution they feared losing their power and joined wide coalitions with the counter-revolution .  The Ottoman Empire was undergoing a protracted decline, as it failed to keep up with the technological advances in Europe.
The Tulip period symbolized a period of peace and reorientation towards European society, after victory against a burgeoning Russian Empire in the Pruth River Campaign .
Throughout the century various reforms were introduced with limited success.
The 18th century also marked the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as an independent state.
The once powerful and vast kingdom, that was once able to conquer Moscow and defeat the great Ottoman armies, collapsed under numerous invasions.
Its semi-democratic government system was not efficient enough to rival the neighbouring monarchies of Prussia , Russia and Austria who divided the Commonwealth territories among them, changing the landscape of Central European politics for the next hundred years.
Great Britain became a major power worldwide with the defeat of France in the Americas , in the 1760s and the conquest of large parts of India .
However, Britain lost much of its North American colonies after the American Revolution , which was actively helped by the French.
The industrial revolution started in Britain around 1770s with the production of the improved steam engine .
Despite its modest beginnings in the 18th century, it would radically change human society and the environment.
Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work.
For example, the "short" 18th century may be defined as 1715–1789, denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution with an emphasis on directly interconnected events. To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements, the "long" 18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later.
The Eiffel Tower (, ) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris , named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel , whose company designed and built the tower.
Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair , it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011.
The third level observatory's upper platform is at the highest accessible to public in the European Union and the highest in Europe as long as the platform of the Ostankino Tower , at , remains closed as a result of the fire of August 2000.
The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010.
The tower stands tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building.
During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930.
Because of the addition, in 1957, of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building.
Not including broadcast antennas , it is the second-tallest structure in France , after the Millau Viaduct .
The tower has three levels for visitors.
Tickets can be purchased to ascend, by stairs or lift (elevator), to the first and second levels.
The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the walk from the first to the second level.
The third and highest level is accessible only by lift—stairs do exist but are usually closed to the public.
The first and second levels have restaurants.
The tower has become the most prominent symbol of both Paris and France, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city.

Shiva () (literally "seven") is the week- long mourning period in Judaism for first-degree relatives: father , mother , son , daughter , brother , sister , and spouse .
The ritual is referred to as "sitting shiva." Immediately after burial , people assume the halakhic status of "avel" ().
This state lasts for seven days, during which family members traditionally gather in one home (preferably the home of the deceased) and receive visitors. At the funeral, mourners traditionally rend an outer garment, a ritual known as keriah .
This garment is worn throughout shiva.
A hot toddy, also hot totty, and hot tottie, is typically a mixed drink made of liquor and water with sugar and spices and served hot.
Hot toddy recipes vary and are traditionally drunk before going to bed, or in wet or cold weather.
They were once believed to relieve the symptoms of the cold and flu — in How to Drink, Victoria Moore describes the drink as "the vitamin C for health, the honey to soothe, the alcohol to numb" — but the American Lung Association recommends avoiding treating the common cold with alcoholic beverages as they cause dehydration .
The Swiss Psalm (, , , ) is the national anthem of Switzerland .
It was composed in 1841, by Alberich Zwyssig (1808–1854).
Since then, it has been frequently sung at patriotic events.
The Federal Council declined however on numerous occasions to accept the psalm as the official anthem.
This was because the council wanted the people to express their say on what they wanted as a national anthem.
From 1961 to 1981 it provisionally replaced ("When You Call, My Country", French ; Italian , Romansh ) the anthem by Johann Rudolf Wyss (1743–1818) which was set to the melody of God Save the Queen .
On April 1, 1981, the Swiss Psalm was declared the official Swiss national anthem.
The American Civil War (ACW), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War (see naming ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States (the "Union" or the "North") and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the "Confederacy" or the "South").
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories.
Foreign powers did not intervene.
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States' territories .
Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy.
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal.
Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war.
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession.
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy.
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war.
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on " King Cotton " that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.
Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina.
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy.
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62.
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention.
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal.
To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River.
In 1863, Robert E.
Lee's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Western successes led to Ulysses S.
Grant command of all Union armies in 1864.
In the Western Theater, William T.
Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way.
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital.
The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively.
The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I . It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.
The Kentucky Derby () is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds , held annually in Louisville, Kentucky, United States , on the first Saturday in May, capping the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival .
The race is one and a quarter miles (2 km) at Churchill Downs .
Colts and geldings carry and fillies .
The race is known in the United States as "The Most Exciting Two Minutes In Sports" or "The Fastest Two Minutes in Sports" for its approximate duration, and is also called "The Run for the Roses" for the blanket of roses draped over the winner.
It is the first leg of the US Triple Crown and is followed by the Preakness Stakes , then the Belmont Stakes .
Unlike the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, which took hiatuses in 1891- 1893 and 1911-1912 respectively, the Kentucky Derby has been run every consecutive year since 1875.
A horse must win all three races to win the Triple Crown.
The attendance at the Kentucky Derby ranks first in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes and the Breeders' Cup.
The organization and structure of British colonial governments in America shared many attributes.
While each of the Thirteen Colonies destined to become the United States had its own history and development, over time common features and patterns emerged in the structure and organization of the governments. By the time of the American Revolution in 1775, most of these features applied to most of the colonies.
The Late Late Show is an American late- night television talk and variety show on CBS . It first aired in January 1995, with host Tom Snyder .
In its current incarnation it has been hosted by Craig Ferguson since January 2005.
It is produced by Worldwide Pants Incorporated , the production company owned by the host of the show that immediately precedes it.
Late Show with David Letterman .
It originates from CBS Television City (in a studio immediately above the Bob Barker Studio ) and is shot in High Definition , as of August 31, 2009.
The program dates to 1995, and has had three permanent hosts.
The show differs from most of the other extant late-night talk shows in that it has never used a house band nor an in- studio announcer.
Occasionally, the show is split into 15- and 45-minute segments when CBS airs a daily late night highlight show for either The Masters , other PGA Tour events with rights owned by CBS, or tennis ' U.S.
Open .
The show then has a monologue to start, followed by sports highlights, and then the guest segments.
Since mid-2007, however, the highlights show has aired first, followed by the full hour of The Late Late Show.
Puce (often misspelled as "puse", "peuse" or "peuce") is defined in the United States as a brownish-purple color.
In the UK, it is defined as a purple brown or a dark red.
In France, where it was invented, it is described as a rather dark reddish brown.
The color on the map below is closer to the common American version.
The colors in the boxes at right are two of the various shades and varieties of puce.
Space monkey " Baker " rode a Jupiter IRBM into space in 1959.
Animals in space originally only served to test the survivability of spaceflight , before manned space missions were attempted.
Later, animals were also flown to investigate various biological processes and the effects microgravity and space flight might have on them.
Six national space programs have flown animals into space: the Soviet Union , the United States , France , China , Japan and Iran .
Nana Joseph Kwame Kyeretwie Boakye Danquah (December 1895 – 4 February 1965) was a Ghanaian statesman , pan- Africanist , scholar and historian .
He played a significant role in pre- and post-colonial Ghana.
In fact, he is credited with giving Ghana its name.
During his political career, he was one of the primary opposition leaders to Ghanaian president and independence leader Kwame Nkrumah .
Milton Powell (born December 4, 1977), better known by his stage name Big Pokey, is a rap artist from Houston, Texas and is one of the original members of the Screwed Up Click .
Big Pokey joined up with DJ Screw in the early 1990s and started releasing songs on DJ Screw's many mixtapes .
His first full-length album appeared in late 1999, " Hardest Pit in the Litter ".
The following year, Pokey returned with " D-Game " 2000, another album of mid- tempo 808-driven beats featuring several of his Houston peers as guests.
In 2001, he collaborated with the Wreckshop Wolfpack for Collabo and then returned in 2002 with another solo album, " Da Sky's Da Limit ".
In 2004, as the popularity of Houston rap expanded nationwide, HBO's hit series Entourage featured a clip of Pokey's song "Who Dat Talkin Down" in its pilot episode. In 2005 he was featured in a song which was #93 on US Top 100 [][] with Paul Wall called Sittin' Sidewayz .
Field Lacrosse, sometimes referred to as the "fastest sport on two feet," is a full contact outdoor men's sport played with ten players on each team.
The sport originated among Native Americans , and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867.
Field lacrosse is one of three major versions of lacrosse played internationally.
The other versions, women's lacrosse (established in the 1890s) and box lacrosse (which originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly different rules.
The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into an opponent's goal.
The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball .
In addition to the lacrosse stick, players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment.
Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact.
The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal.
Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 31-member Federation of International Lacrosse , which sponsors the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years.
A former Olympic sport , attempts by the international governing body to reinstate it to the Games has been hampered by insufficient international participation and by the existence of separate governing bodies for the men's and women's versions of the sport until 2008.
Field lacrosse is played professionally in North America by the Major League Lacrosse .
It is also played on a high amateur level by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States, the Australian Senior Lacrosse Championship series, and the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association .
Pressure as exerted by particle collisions inside a closed container.
Pressure (the symbol: p) is the ratio of force to the area over which that force is distributed.
Pressure is force per unit area applied in a direction perpendicular to the surface of an object.
Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure) is the pressure relative to the local atmospheric or ambient pressure.
While pressure may be measured in any unit of force divided by any unit of area, the SI unit of pressure (the newton per square metre ) is called the pascal (Pa) after the seventeenth-century philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal .
A pressure of 1 Pa is small; it approximately equals the pressure exerted by a dollar bill resting flat on a table.
Everyday pressures are often stated in kilopascals (1 kPa = 1000 Pa).
Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth 's continental crust , after feldspar .
It is made up of a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon – oxygen tetrahedra , with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall formula SiO2 .
There are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are semi- precious gemstones .
Especially in Europe and the Middle East, varieties of quartz have been since antiquity the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings . The word "quartz" is derived from the German word "Quarz" and its Middle High German ancestor "twarc", which probably originated in Slavic (cf.
Czech tvrdý ("hard"), Polish twardy ("hard")).
Front of thorax , showing surface relations of bones , lungs (purple), pleura (blue), and heart (red outline).
Heart valves are labeled with "B", "T", "A", and "P".First heart sound: caused by atrioventricular valves - Bicuspid/Mitral (B) and Tricuspid (T). Second heart sound caused by semilunar valves -- Aortic (A) and Pulmonary/Pulmonic (P). In cardiology, Erb's point refers to the third intercostal space on the left sternal border where S2 is best auscultated .
It is essentially the same location as what is referred to with left lower sternal border (LLSB). Some sources include the fourth left interspace.
The official logo of Pokémon for its international release; "Pokémon" is short for the original Japanese title of "Pocket Monsters".
Originally released as a pair of interlinkable Game Boy role-playing video games developed by Game Freak , Pokémon has since become the second-most successful and lucrative video game-based media franchise in the world, behind only Nintendo's own Mario franchise .
Pokémon properties have since been merchandised into anime , manga , trading cards , toys, books, and other media.
The franchise celebrated in 2006, and , cumulative sales of the video games (including home console versions, such as the "Pikachu" Nintendo 64 ) have reached more than 200 million copies.
In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment , which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement.
Pokémon USA Inc. (now The Pokémon Company International ), a subsidiary of Japan's Pokémon Co., now oversees all Pokémon licensing outside of Asia.
The name Pokémon is the romanized contraction of the Japanese brand .
The term Pokémon, in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 649 fictional species that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the fifth generation titles Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 ; with the upcoming releases of Pokémon X and Y , 6 new Pokémon have been featured in promotions for the games .
Pokémon" is identical in both the singular and plural , as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu " and "many

Lucy is the common name of AL 288-1, several hundred pieces of bone representing about 40% of the skeleton of an individual Australopithecus afarensis .
It was discovered in 1974 at Hadar in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia 's Afar Depression .
In paleoanthropology , usually only fossil fragments were found, and only rarely were skulls or ribs uncovered intact; thus this discovery was an astounding feat, that provided an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence.
Lucy is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago, and is classified as a hominin .
The skeleton shows evidence of small skull capacity akin to that of apes and of bipedal upright walk akin to that of humans , supporting the debated view that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size in human evolution.

Saint Patrick's Day or the Feast of Saint Patrick (, "the Day of the Festival of Patrick") is a cultural and religious holiday celebrated on 17 March.
It is named after Saint Patrick ( AD 385– 461), the most commonly recognised of the patron saints of Ireland . Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early seventeenth century and is observed by the Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland ), the Eastern Orthodox Church and Lutheran Church .
The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland , as well as celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general.
Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilithe , and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks .
Christians also attend church services , and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption.
Saint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland , Northern Ireland , Newfoundland and Labrador and Montserrat .
It is also widely celebrated by the Irish diaspora around the world; especially in Britain, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand.
A coffee bearer, from the Ottoman quarters in Cairo , Egypt , in the year 1857 The history of coffee goes at least as far back as the thirteenth century.
The story of Kaldi , the 9th-century Ethiopian goat herder who discovered coffee while searching for his goats, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.
From Ethiopia, coffee was said to have spread to Egypt and Yemen .
The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the fifteenth century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen.
By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia , Turkey and northern Africa .  Coffee then spread to Balkans, Italy and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia and then to America.

Puerto Rico ( or , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (), is an unincorporated territory of the United States, located in the northeastern Caribbean, east of the Dominican Republic and west of both the United States Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands .
Puerto Rico (Spanish for "rich port") comprises an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands, the largest of which are Vieques , Culebra , and Mona .
The main island of Puerto Rico is the smallest by land area of the Greater Antilles .
It ranks third in population among that group of four islands, which include Cuba , Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti ), and Jamaica .
Due to its location, Puerto Rico enjoys a tropical climate and is subject to the Atlantic hurricane season.  Official languages of the island are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language.
Originally populated for centuries by indigenous aboriginal peoples known as Taínos , the island was claimed by Christopher Columbus for Spain during his second voyage to the Americas on November 19, 1493.
Under Spanish rule, the island was colonized and the indigenous population was forced into slavery and wiped out due to, among other things, European infectious diseases.
Spain possessed Puerto Rico for over 400 years, despite attempts at capture of the island by the French, Dutch, and British.
In 1898, Spain ceded the archipelago, as well as the Philippines, to the United States as a result of its defeat in the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 .
In 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship and since 1948 have elected their own governor .
In 1952 the Constitution of Puerto Rico was adopted and ratified by the electorate.
A democratically elected bicameral legislature is in place but the United States Congress legislates many fundamental aspects of Puerto Rican life.
The islanders may not vote in U.S. presidential elections because the territory is not a state.
The island's current political status , including the possibility of statehood or independence , is widely debated in Puerto Rico.
In November 2012, a non-binding referendum resulted in fifty-four percent of respondents voting to reject the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S.
Constitution.
Among respondents to a second question about alternatives, sixty-one percent voted for statehood as the preferred alternative to the current territorial status.
However, partly because of criticism of the referedum's process, President Barack Obama stated in April 2013 that he will seek $2.5 million to hold another one, this time the first Puerto Rican status referendum to be financed by the Federal government .

A classic car is an older car ; the exact definition varies around the world.
The Classic Car Club of America maintains that a car must be between 30 and 59 years old to be a classic, while cars between 60 and 99 fall into a pre- antique class, and cars 100 years and older fall into the Antique Class .
In the UK 'classic cars' range from Veteran (pre first world war), Vintage (1919–1930), Post-Vintage (1930s).
Post second world war classic cars are not so precisely defined.
Mao Zedong (, also transliterated as Mao Tse-tung ), commonly referred to as Chairman Mao (December 26, 1893September 9, 1976), was a Chinese communist revolutionary, politician and socio-political theorist.
The founding father of the People's Republic of China from its establishment in 1949, he governed the country as Chairman of the Communist Party of China until his death.
In this position he converted China into a single-party socialist state , with industry and business being nationalized under state ownership and socialist reforms implemented in all areas of society.
Politically a Marxist-Leninist , his theoretical contribution to the ideology along with his military strategies and brand of policies are collectively known as Maoism .
Born the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan , Hunan , Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919.
Coming to adopt Marxism-Leninism while working at Peking University , he became an early member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), soon rising to a senior position.
In 1922, the Communists agreed to an alliance with the larger Kuomintang (KMT), a nationalist revolutionary party, whom Mao aided in creating a revolutionary peasant army and organizing rural land reform.
In 1927 the KMT's military leader Chiang Kai-shek broke the alliance and set about on an anti-communist purge; in turn, the CPC formed an army of peasant militia, and the two sides clashed in the Chinese Civil War .
Mao was responsible for commanding a part of the CPC's Red Army , and after several setbacks, rose to power in the party by leading the Long March .
When the Empire of Japan invaded China in 1937, sparking the Second Sino-Japanese War , Mao agreed to a united front with the KMT, resulting in a CPC-KMT victory in 1945.
The Chinese Civil War then resumed, in which Mao led the Red Army to victory as Chiang and his supporters fled to Taiwan .
In 1949 Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic of China, a one- party socialist state controlled by the Communist Party.
After solidifying the reunification of China through his Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries , Mao enacted sweeping land reform , overthrowing the feudal landlords before seizing their large estates and dividing the land into people's communes .
He proceeded to lead a nationwide political campaign known as the Great Leap Forward from 1958 through to 1961, designed to modernize and industrialize the country, however agrarian problems worsened by his policies led to widespread famine. In 1966, he initiated the Cultural Revolution , a program to weed out counter-revolutionary elements in Chinese society, which continued until his death.
A deeply controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important individuals in modern world history.
Supporters praise him for modernizing China and building it into a world power, through promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, providing universal housing and raising life expectancy.
In addition, China's population almost doubled during the period of Mao's leadership, from around 550 to over 900 million.
As a result, Mao is still officially held in high regard by many Chinese as a great political strategist, military mastermind, and savior of the nation.
Maoists furthermore promote his role as a theorist, statesman, poet, and visionary, who has inspired revolutionary movements across the globe.
In contrast, historians have described him a dictator whose administration oversaw systematic human rights abuses , and whose rule is estimated to have caused the deaths of 40–70 million people mainly through starvation, forced labor and executions, placing his rule at the top of the list of most people killed by democide in human history.
The prostate (from Greek προστάτης – prostates, literally "one who stands before", "protector", "guardian") is a compound tubuloalveolar exocrine gland of the male reproductive system in most mammals .

United States Air Force laser experiment Red (635 nm), green (532 nm), and blue- violet (445 nm) lasers A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation .
The term "laser" originated as an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
Lasers differ from other sources of light because they emit light coherently .
Its spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, and this enables applications like laser cutting and laser lithography .
Its spatial coherence also keeps a laser beam collimated over long distances, and this enables laser pointers to work.
Laser also have high temporal coherence which allows them to have a very narrow spectrum , i.e., they only emit a single color of light.
Their temporal coherence also allows them to emit pulses of light that only last a femtosecond .
Lasers have many important applications.
They are used in common consumer devices such as DVD players , laser printers , and barcode scanners .
They are used in medicine for laser surgery and various skin treatments, and in industry for cutting and welding materials.
They are used in military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed.
Laser lighting displays use laser light as an entertainment medium.
Lasers also have many important applications in scientific research.
Sermon on the Mount by Carl Bloch The Sermon on the Mount ( anglicized from the Matthean Vulgate Latin section title: Sermo in monte) is a collection of sayings and teachings of Jesus , which emphasizes his moral teaching found in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5 , 6 and 7 ). It is the first of the Five Discourses of Matthew and takes place relatively early in the Ministry of Jesus after he has been baptized by John the Baptist and preached in Galilee .
The Sermon is the longest piece of teaching from Jesus in the New Testament , and has been one of the most widely quoted elements of the Canonical Gospels .
It includes some of the best known teachings of Jesus, such as the Beatitudes , and the widely recited Lord's Prayer .
To most believers in Jesus, the Sermon on the Mount contains the central tenets of Christian discipleship .
The last verse of chapter 5 is considered to be a focal point that summarizes the teaching of the sermon: "be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect", advising his disciples and followers to seek the path towards perfection and the Kingdom of God .

The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the United States, culminating a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year.
The Super Bowl uses Roman numerals to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held.
For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season , while Super Bowl XLVII was played on February 3, 2013, following the 2012 season .
The game was created as part of a merger agreement between the NFL and its then-rival league, the American Football League (AFL). It was agreed that the two leagues' champion teams would play in an AFL– NFL World Championship Game until the merger was to officially begin in 1970.
After the merger, each league was redesignated as a " conference ", and the game was then played between the conference champions.
Currently, the National Football Conference (NFC) leads the series with 25 wins to 22 wins for the American Football Conference (AFC). The day on which the Super Bowl is played, now considered by some a de facto American national holiday , is called " Super Bowl Sunday ".
It is the second-largest day for U.S. food consumption, after Thanksgiving Day .
In addition, the Super Bowl has frequently been the most watched American television broadcast of the year.
Super Bowl XLV, played in 2011, became the most-watched American television program in history, drawing an average audience of 111 million viewers and taking over the spot held by the previous year's Super Bowl, which itself had taken over the #1 spot held for twenty-eight years by the final episode of M*A*S*H . The Super Bowl is also among the most watched sporting events in the world , almost all being North American audiences, and is second to association football ’s UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide.
Because of its high viewership, commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year.
Due to the high cost of investing in advertising on the Super Bowl, companies regularly develop their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast. As a result, watching and discussing the broadcast's commercials has become a significant aspect of the event.
In addition, many popular singers and musicians have performed during the event's pre-game and halftime ceremonies because of the exposure.
It is also included on Curtain Call: The Hits , performed with Eminem and Dido on track 5 and on track 17 as a live Performance from the 2001 Grammy awards featuring Elton John , which was censored on both the clean and explicit versions.
The song was produced by The 45 King , and uses a slightly modified break from Dido's " Thank You " as its base sample.
The track also samples the opening lines of "Thank You" as its chorus.
Coincidentally, both songs were released as singles in late 2000.
The song was also listed at #15 on VH1's list of the greatest hip hop songs of all-time.
The song was nominated for multiple awards like the Best Song at the MTV Europe Music Awards , Video of the Year , Best Rap Video, Best Direction , Best Cinematography at the MTV Video Music Awards .
The only award it won was the Best International Artist Video at the MuchMusic Video Awards .
In April 2011, Complex magazine put together a list of the 100 Greatest Eminem songs, ranking "Stan" at #2.
The name of the character in the namesake song has given rise to a slang term online which refers to overzealous maniacal obsessed fans of a celebrity or personality.
Sadomasochism is the giving and/or receiving of pleasure—often sexual— from acts involving the infliction or reception of pain or humiliation .
A subset of BDSM , practitioners of sadomasochism usually seek out sexual gratification from these acts, but often seek out other forms of pleasure as well.
While the terms sadist and masochist specifically refer to one who either enjoys giving pain (sadist), or one who enjoys receiving pain (masochist), many practitioners of sadomasochism describe themselves as at least somewhat of a switch , or someone who can receive pleasure from either inflicting or receiving pain.
The acronym S&M is often used for sadomasochism, although practitioners themselves normally drop the & and use the acronym SM or S/M.
Sadomasochism is not considered a clinical paraphilia unless such practices lead to clinically significant distress or impairment for a diagnosis.
Similarly, sexual sadism within the context of mutual consent should not be mistaken for acts of sexual violence or aggression.
SpongeBob SquarePants (often referred to simply as SpongeBob) is an American animated television series, created by animator Stephen Hillenburg .
Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom.
The series' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise , contributing to its position as Nickelodeon 's highest rated show, the most distributed property of MTV Networks , and among Nicktoons' most watched shows.
It is listed 15th in IGN's top 100 animated series list.
When Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants. He teamed up with several Nickelodeon veterans and Rocko crew members, including creative director Derek Drymon ( Action League Now! , Hey Arnold! , and Rocko's Modern Life) writers and directors Sherm Cohen , and Dan Povenmire , writer Tim Hill , actor and writer Martin Olson , animation director Alan Smart (all from Rocko's Modern Life), and story editor Merriwether Williams ( The Angry Beavers ), who worked on the series for its first few seasons and switched to SpongeBob SquarePants in July 1999.
To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on Rocko's Modern Life.
Steve described SpongeBob to me as childlike and naïve," Kenny said in an interview. 0 Q2499 what is spongebob's real address D1349 SpongeBob SquarePants D1349- 8 "He’s not quite an adult, he’s not quite a kid. 0 Q2499 what is spongebob's real address D1349 SpongeBob SquarePants D1349- 9 Think a Stan Laurel, Jerry Lewis kind of child-man. 0 Q2499 what is spongebob's real address D1349 SpongeBob SquarePants D1349- 10 Kind of like a Munchkin but not quite, kind of like a kid, but not in a Charlie Brown child’s voice on the TV shows.
Originally, SpongeBob was to be named SpongeBoy, but this name was already in use.
This was discovered after voice-acting for the original seven-minute pilot was recorded in 1997.
The Nickelodeon legal department discovered that the name was already in use for a mop product.
Upon finding this out, Hillenburg decided that the character's given name still had to contain "Sponge" so viewers would not mistake the character for a "Cheese Man".
Hillenburg decided to use the name "SpongeBob".
He chose "SquarePants" as a family name as it referred to the character's square shape and it had a "nice ring to it".
The pilot episode of SpongeBob SquarePants first aired in the United States on Nickelodeon on May 1, 1999, following the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards .
The first episodes were called " Help Wanted ", "Reef Blower", and " Tea at the Treedome ".
The "official" series premiere followed on July 17, 1999, with the second episode, "Bubblestand/Ripped Pants." The show reached enormous popularity by 2000 during the second season, and has remained popular since.
A feature film of the series was released in theaters on November 19, 2004, with a sequel in development and slated for release in late-2014.
The series celebrated its tenth anniversary on July 17, 2009.
So far the series has aired 334 individual episodes.
It is currently Nickelodeon's longest- running cartoon, and currently in its ninth season .
SpongeBob surpassed Rugrats (in terms of number of episodes) when SpongeBob aired its 173rd episode on April 11, 2012 (while Rugrats had 172 episodes).
On April 12, 2012, SpongeBob aired its 174th episode and has produced 204 episodes, and more episodes will be produced, marking it as the first Nicktoon to have 200 or more episodes.
On July 21, 2012, SpongeBob was renewed and aired its ninth season .
This is the first SpongeBob season to have regular episodes produced in widescreen.
An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court or court of appeals ( American English ) or appeal court ( British English ) or court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal . In most jurisdictions , the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts.
A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court.
Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules.
The authority of appellate courts to review decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.
In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review.
Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'". 0 Q2509 what is the second season of tsubasa called?

I2C (referred to as I-squared-C, inter-IC or I-two-C) is a multimaster serial single- ended computer bus invented by Philips used for attaching low-speed peripherals to a motherboard , embedded system , cellphone , or other electronic device.
Not to be confused with the term Two Wire Interface which only describes a compatible hardware interface.
Since the mid-1990s, several competitors (e.g., Siemens AG (later Infineon Technologies AG, now Intel mobile communications), NEC, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics (formerly SGS-Thomson), Motorola (later Freescale), Intersil, etc.) brought I2C products on the market, which are fully compatible with the NXP (formerly Philips' semiconductor division) I2C- system.
Since October 10, 2006, no licensing fees are required to implement the I2C protocol.
However, fees are still required to obtain I2C slave addresses allocated by NXP. SMBus , defined by Intel in 1995, is a subset of I2C that defines the protocols more strictly.
One purpose of SMBus is to promote robustness and interoperability.
Accordingly, modern I2C systems incorporate policies and rules from SMBus, sometimes supporting both I2C and SMBus with minimal reconfiguration required.
The Tour de France () is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France , while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries.
The race was first organized in 1903 to increase paper sales for the magazine L'Auto ; it is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation .
The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except for when it was stopped for the two World Wars . As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe.
Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year.
The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI ProTeams , with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.
Along with the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España , the Tour makes up cycling's prestigious, three-week-long Grand Tours .
Traditionally, the race is usually held primarily in the month of July.
While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same with the appearance of at least two time trials, the passage through the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps , and the finish on the Champs-Élysées .
The modern editions of the Tour de France consist of 21 day-long segments (stages) over a 23-day period.
All of the stages are timed to the finish; after finishing the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times.
The rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race and gets to don the coveted yellow jersey .
While the general classification garners the most attention there are other contests held within the Tour: the points classification for the sprinters, the mountains classification for the climbers with general classification hopes, young rider classification for the riders under the age of 26, and the team classification for the fastest teams.
The 2012 edition of the race was won by Great Britain's Bradley Wiggins , the first British winner in the history of the Tour de France.
The social norms approach, or social norms marketing, is an environmental strategy gaining ground in health campaigns.
While conducting research in the mid- 1980s, two researchers, H.W.
Perkins and A.D.
Berkowitz , reported that students at a small U.S. college held exaggerated beliefs about the normal frequency and consumption habits of other students with regard to alcohol.
These inflated perceptions have been found in many educational institutions, with varying populations and locations.
Despite the fact that college drinking is at elevated levels, the perceived amount almost always exceeds actual behavior The social norms approach has shown signs of countering misperceptions, however research on resulting changes in behavior resulting from changed perceptions varies between mixed to conclusively nonexistent.
Packet switching is a digital networking communications method that groups all transmitted data – regardless of content, type, or structure – into suitably sized blocks, called packets .
First proposed for military uses in the early 1960s and implemented on small networks in 1968, this method of data transmission became one of the fundamental networking technologies behind the Internet and most local area networks .
Packet switching features delivery of variable-bit-rate data streams (sequences of packets) over a shared network.
When traversing network adapters, switches, routers and other network nodes , packets are buffered and queued, resulting in variable delay and throughput depending on the traffic load in the network.
Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching , a method which sets up a limited number of dedicated connections of constant bit rate and constant delay between nodes for exclusive use during the communication session. In case of traffic fees (as opposed to flat rate), for example in cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per time unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching is characterized by a fee per unit of information.
Packet mode communication may be utilized with or without intermediate forwarding nodes (packet switches or routers ).
In all packet mode communication, network resources are managed by statistical multiplexing or dynamic bandwidth allocation in which a communication channel is effectively divided into an arbitrary number of logical variable-bit-rate channels or data streams.
Statistical multiplexing, packet switching and other store-and-forward buffering introduces varying latency and throughput in the transmission.
Each logical stream consists of a sequence of packets, which normally are forwarded by the multiplexers and intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering.
Alternatively, the packets may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing , traffic shaping or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service , such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket .
In case of a shared physical medium, the packets may be delivered according to some packet-mode multiple access scheme.

According to the Constitution , education is compulsory and free in public schools for the initial , primary and secondary levels.
It is also free in public universities for students who are unable to pay tuition and have an adequate academic performance.
As of 2008, various institutions such as UNESCO , World Bank , and the Inter- American Development Bank have stated that Peru has the best education system in Latin America and that primary, secondary, and superior education attendance rates were the highest in Latin America.
Republic of Texas Comancheria prior to 1850 In 1845, the United States of America annexed the Republic of Texas and admitted it to the Union as the 28th state .
The U.S. thus inherited Texas' border dispute with Mexico ; this quickly led to the Mexican-American War , during which the U.S. captured additional territory (known as the Mexican Cession of 1848), extending the nation's borders all the way to the Pacific Ocean .
Texas claimed the eastern part of this new territory, comprising parts of present-day Colorado , Kansas , New Mexico , Texas , Wyoming , Utah , and Oklahoma .
The resulting dispute among Texas, the federal government, and New Mexico Territory was resolved in the Compromise of 1850 , when much of these lands became parts of other territories of the United States in exchange for the U.S. federal government assuming the Texas Republic's $10 million in debt. Altair (Alpha Aquilae, Alpha Aql, α Aquilae, α Aql, Atair) is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the night sky.
It is currently in the G-cloud .
Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega ).
Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the equator of approximately 286 km/s.
A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation.
Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared , have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.
The Articles of Confederation : predecessor to the U.S.
Constitution and drafted from Anti-Federalist principles Anti-Federalism refers to a movement that opposed the creation of a stronger U.S. federal government and which later opposed the ratification of the Constitution of 1787.
The previous constitution, called the Articles of Confederation , gave state governments more authority.
Led by Patrick Henry of Virginia, Anti- Federalists worried, among other things, that the position of president, then a novelty, might evolve into a monarchy .
A book titled "The Anti-Federalist Papers " is a detailed explanation of American Anti-Federalist thought.
During the American Revolution and its immediate aftermath the term "federal" was applied to any person who supported the colonial union and the government formed under the Articles of Confederation .
After the war the group who felt that the national government under the Articles was too weak appropriated the name Federalist for themselves.
Historian Jackson Turner Main wrote that, "to them, the man of 'federal principles' approved of 'federal measures,' which meant those that increased the weight and authority or extended the influence of the Confederation Congress." As the Federalists moved to amend the Articles, eventually leading to the Constitutional Convention , they applied the term anti-federalist to their opposition.
The term implied, correctly or not, both opposition to Congress and unpatriotic motives.
The Anti-Federalists rejected the term, arguing that they were the true Federalists.
In both their correspondence and their local groups they tried to capture the term.
For example, an unknown anti-federalist signed his public correspondence as "A Federal Farmer" and the New York committee opposing the Constitution was called the "Federal Republican Committee." However the Federalists carried the day and the name Anti-Federalist forever stuck.
The Anti-Federalists were composed of diverse elements, including those opposed to the Constitution because they thought that a stronger government threatened the sovereignty and prestige of the states, localities, or individuals; those that claimed a new centralized, disguised "monarchic" power that would only replace the cast-off despotism of Great Britain with the proposed government; and those who simply feared that the new government threatened their personal liberties.
Some of the opposition believed that the central government under the Articles of Confederation was sufficient.
Still others believed that while the national government under the Articles was too weak, the national government under the Constitution would be too strong. Another complaint of the Anti-Federalists was that the Constitution provided for a centralized rather than Federal Government (and in the Federalist papers James Madison admits that the new Constitution has the characteristics of both a centralized and federal form of the government) and that a truly federal form of government was a leaguing of states as under the Articles of Confederation.
During the period of debate over the ratification of the Constitution, numerous independent local speeches and articles were published all across the country.
Initially, many of the articles in opposition were written under pseudonyms, such as " Brutus ," " Centinel ," and " Federal Farmer ." Eventually, famous revolutionary figures such as Patrick Henry came out publicly against the Constitution.
They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to the rights of individuals and that the President would become a king.
They objected to the federal court system created by the proposed constitution.
This produced a phenomenal body of political writing; the best and most influential of these articles and speeches were gathered by historians into a collection known as the Anti-Federalist Papers in allusion to the Federalist Papers .
In every state the opposition to the Constitution was strong, and in two states — North Carolina and Rhode Island — it prevented ratification until the definite establishment of the new government practically forced their adherence.
Individualism was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt.
In Rhode Island resistance against the Constitution was so strong that civil war almost broke out on July 4, 1788, when anti-federalist members of the Country Party led by Judge William West marched into Providence with over 1,000 armed protesters.
The Anti-Federalists played upon these feelings in the ratification convention in Massachusetts .
By this point, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease, but the Massachusetts convention was far more bitter and contentious.
Finally, after long debate, a compromise (known as the " Massachusetts compromise ") was reached.
Minimum wage by U.S. state and U.S. territory ( American Samoa , Guam , Puerto Rico , Virgin Islands ), as of Jan. 1, 2013.
In the United States, workers are generally entitled to be paid no less than the statutory minimum wage .
The federal government mandates a nationwide minimum wage level of $7.25 per hour, while some states and municipalities have set minimum wage levels higher than the federal level, with the highest state minimum wage being $9.19 per hour in Washington as of 2013.
Among those paid by the hour in 2012, 1.6 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage.
About 2.0 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum.
Together, these 3.6 million workers with wages at or below the minimum made up 4.7 percent of all hourly-paid workers.

Red Bull is an energy drink sold by Austrian company Red Bull GmbH , created in 1987.
In terms of market share, Red Bull is the most popular energy drink in the world, with 4.6 billion cans sold in 2011.
Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz was inspired by a pre- existing energy drink named Krating Daeng (, ), which was first invented and sold in Thailand .
He took this idea, modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of westerners, and, in partnership with Chaleo Yoovidhya , founded Red Bull GmbH in Austria.
In Thai , daeng means red, and krating is the reddish-brown bovine called a " gaur ", which is an animal slightly larger than the bison .
Red Bull is sold in a tall and slim blue- silver can; in Thailand and in some parts of Asia it is sold in a wider gold can with the name of Krating Daeng or Red Bull Classic.
The two are different products, produced separately.
The company slogan is "Red Bull gives you wings" and the product is marketed through advertising , events ( Red Bull Air Race , Red Bull Crashed Ice ), sports team ownerships ( Red Bull Racing , Scuderia Toro Rosso , EC Red Red_Bull_Salzburg Bull Red_Bull_Salzburg Salzburg Red_Bull_Salzburg , FC Red Red_Bull_Salzburg Bull Red_Bull_Salzburg Salzburg Red_Bull_Salzburg , Red Bull New York , RB Leipzig Leipzig , Red Bull Brasil ), celebrity endorsements, and music, through its record label Red Bull Records .
Red Bull has been the target of criticism concerning the possible health risks associated with the drink.
A study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that in the levels used in popular energy drinks, like Red Bull, taurine and glucuronolactone are safe.
Tariffs in United States history have played important roles in trade policy , political debates and the nation's economic history .
The 1st United States Congress , wanting a straightforward tax that was not too onerous and easy to collect, passed the Tariff of 1790 .
Like all subsequent tariffs it taxed imported goods at their Ports of entry to raise revenue for the federal government.
Treasury agents collected the tariff before goods could be landed, and what became the Coast Guard prevented smuggling.
Tariffs were the largest (approaching 95% at times) source of federal revenue until the Federal income tax began after 1913.
For well over a century the federal government was largely financed by tariffs averaging about 20% on foreign imports.
There are no tariffs for imports or shipments from other states.
Since the 1940s foreign trade policies have focused more on reciprocal tariffs and low tariff rates rather than using tariffs as a significant source of Federal tax revenue.
The goal of using higher tariffs to promote industrialization was urged by the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton , and after him the Whig Party. They generally failed because Jeffersonian and Jacksonian Democrats said the tariff should be only high enough to pay the government's bills.
The Republicans , however, made high tariffs the centerpiece of their economic policy beginning in 1861, and as late as 1930.
Since 1930 tariffs have not been a major political issue.
Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, c.
February 1818 – February 20, 1895) was an American social reformer, orator , writer and statesman .
After escaping from slavery , he became a leader of the abolitionist movement, gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writing.  He stood as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves did not have the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.
Many Northerners also found it hard to believe that such a great orator had been a slave.
Douglass wrote several autobiographies, eloquently describing his experiences in slavery in his 1845 autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave , which became influential in its support for abolition.
He wrote two more autobiographies, with his last, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass , published in 1881 and covering events through and after the Civil War.
After the Civil War , Douglass remained active in the United States' struggle to reach its potential as a "land of the free".
Douglass actively supported women's suffrage .
Without his approval, he became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States as the running mate of Victoria Woodhull on the impracticable and small Equal Rights Party ticket.
Douglass held multiple public offices.
Douglass was a firm believer in the equality of all people, whether black , female , Native American , or recent immigrant , famously quoted as saying, "I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong." Thomas Charles "Tommy" Lasorda (born September 22, 1927) is a former Major League baseball player, who has had a lengthy career in sports management .
In 2009, he marked his sixth decade in one capacity or another with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers organization, the longest non-continuous (he played one season with the Kansas City Athletics) tenure anyone has had with the team, edging Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully by a single season.
He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 1997.
He was played by actor Arthur J.
Nascarella in the ESPN mini-series The Bronx is Burning .
A gramophone record, commonly known as a phonograph record (in American English ), vinyl record (in reference to vinyl , the material most commonly used after about 1950), or colloquially, "a record", is an analog sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove.
The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc.
Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch, etc.), the rotational speed at which they are played ("33 rpm ", "78", "45", etc.), their time capacity ("long playing"), their reproductive accuracy, or " fidelity " ("high fidelity", "Orthophonic", "full- range", etc.), and the number of channels of audio provided (" mono ", " stereo ", " quadraphonic ", etc.). Phonograph records were the primary medium used for music reproduction for most of the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder , with which it had co-existed, by the 1920s.
By the late 1980s, digital media had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991.
They continue to be manufactured and sold in the 21st century.
In 2008, nearly 2.9 million units shipped, the most in any year since 1998 and the format has continued to slowly regain popularity.
They are especially used by DJs and audiophiles for many types of music.
As of 2013, vinyl records continue to be used for distribution.

When ingested, DMT acts as a psychedelic drug . Depending on the dose and method of administration, its subjective effects can range from short-lived milder psychedelic states to powerful immersive experiences; these are often described as a total loss of connection to conventional reality with the encounter of ineffable spiritual/alien realms.
Indigenous Amazonian Amerindian cultures consume DMT as the primary psychoactive in ayahuasca , a shamanistic brew used for divinatory and healing purposes.
Pharmacologically, ayahuasca combines DMT with an MAOI , an enzyme inhibitor that allows DMT to be orally active.

In the United States , a tax is imposed on income by the federal, most states, and many local governments.
The income tax is determined by applying a tax rate, which may increase as income increases , to taxable income as defined.  Individuals and corporations are directly taxable, and estates and trusts may be taxable on undistributed income.
Partnerships are not taxed, but their partners are taxed on their shares of partnership income.
Residents and citizens are taxed on worldwide income, while nonresidents are taxed only on income within the jurisdiction.
Several types of credits reduce tax, and some types of credits may exceed tax before credits.
An alternative tax applies at the federal and some state levels.
Taxable income is total income less allowable deductions .
Income is broadly defined.
Most business expenses are deductible.
Individuals may also deduct a personal allowance (exemption) and certain personal expenses, including home mortgage interest, state taxes, contributions to charity, and some other items.
Some deductions are subject to limits.
Capital gains are taxable, and capital losses reduce taxable income only to the extent of gains (plus, in certain cases, $3,000 or $1,500 of ordinary income).
Individuals currently pay a lower rate of tax on capital gains and certain corporate dividends.
Taxpayers generally must self assess income tax by filing tax returns.
Advance payments of tax are required in the form of withholding tax or estimated tax payments.
Taxes are determined separately by each jurisdiction imposing tax.
Due dates and other administrative procedures vary by jurisdiction.
April 15 following the tax year is the last day for individuals to file tax returns for federal and many state and local returns.
Tax as determined by the taxpayer may be adjusted by the taxing jurisdiction.

How the West Was Won is a 1962 American epic - Western film.
The picture was one of the last "old- fashioned" epic films made by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer to enjoy great success.
Set between 1839 and 1889, it follows four generations of a family (starting as the Prescotts) as they move ever westward, from western New York state to the Pacific Ocean .
The picture was filmed in the curved- screen three-projector Cinerama process.
The fundamental idea behind the film was to provide an episodic retelling of the progress of westward migration and development of America.
It was inspired by a much longer and more complex series of historical narratives that appeared as a photo essay series, by the same name, three years earlier in Life magazine, which is acknowledged in the film’s credits.
The all-star cast includes (in alphabetical order) Carroll Baker , Walter Brennan , Lee J.
Cobb , Andy Devine , Henry Fonda , Carolyn Jones , Karl Malden , Harry Morgan , Gregory Peck , George Peppard , Robert Preston , Debbie Reynolds , James Stewart , Eli Wallach , John Wayne , and Richard Widmark .
The film is narrated by Spencer Tracy .
The movie consists of five segments, three directed by Henry Hathaway ("The Rivers", "The Plains" and "The Outlaws"), and one each by John Ford ("The Civil War") and George Marshall ("The Railroad"), with transitional sequences by the uncredited Richard Thorpe .
The screenplay was written by John Gay (uncredited) and James R.
Webb .
Popular western author Louis L'Amour wrote a novelization of the screenplay.
In 1997, How the West Was Won was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
The score was listed at #25 on AFI 's 100 Years of Film Scores .

Al Jazeera ( ' , literally "The Island", abbreviating " The [Arabian] Peninsula "), also known as Aljazeera and JSC (Jazeera Satellite Channel), is a broadcaster owned by the privately held Al Jazeera Media Network and headquartered in Doha , Qatar .
Initially launched as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel, Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the Internet and specialty TV channels in multiple languages.
Al Jazeera is accessible in several world regions.
Until 2011, Al Jazeera was owned by the government of Qatar.
Before and after the change, it has emphasized its editorial independence from the government of Qatar, though this has been disputed .
The original Al Jazeera channel's willingness to broadcast dissenting views, for example on call-in shows, created controversies in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf .
The station gained worldwide attention following the outbreak of war in Afghanistan , when it was the only channel to cover the war live, from its office there.
In the 2000s, the network was praised by the Index on Censorship for circumventing censorship and contributing to the free exchange of information in the Arab world, and by the Webby Awards , who nominated it as one of the five best news web sites, along with BBC News , National Geographic and The Smoking Gun .
It was also voted by brandchannel.com readers as the fifth most influential global brand behind Apple , Google , Ikea and Starbucks .
In 2011, Salon.com said Al Jazeera's coverage of the 2011 Egyptian protests was superior to that of the American news media, while U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also opined that the network's news coverage was more informative, and less opinion- driven than American journalism.
Arthralgia (from Greek arthro-, joint + - algos, pain) literally means joint pain ; it is a symptom of injury , infection , illnesses (in particular arthritis ) or an allergic reaction to medication .

In family law and public policy, child support (or child maintenance) is an ongoing, periodic payment made by a parent for the financial benefit of a child following the end of a marriage or other relationship.
Child maintenance is paid directly or indirectly by an obligor to an obligee for the care and support of children of a relationship that has been terminated, or in some cases never existed.
Often the obligor is a non-custodial parent.
The obligee is typically a custodial parent, a caregiver, a guardian, or the state .
Depending on the jurisdiction, a custodial parent may pay child support to a non-custodial parent.
Typically one has the same duty to pay child support irrespective of sex, so a mother is required to pay support to a father just as a father must pay a mother.
Where there is joint custody, the child is considered to have two custodial parents and no non-custodial parents, and a custodial parent with a higher income (obligor) may be required to pay the other custodial parent (obligee). In family law , child support is often arranged as part of a divorce , marital separation , dissolution of marriage , annulment , determination of parentage or dissolution of a civil union and may supplement alimony (spousal support) arrangements.
The right to child support and the responsibilities of parents to provide such support have been internationally recognized.
The 1992 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , a binding convention signed by every member nation of the United Nations and formally ratified by all but Somalia and the United States, declares that the upbringing and development of children and a standard of living adequate for the children's development is a common responsibility of both parents and a fundamental human right for children, and asserts that the primary responsibility to provide such for the children rests with their parents.
Other United Nations documents and decisions related to child support enforcement include the 1956 New York Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance created under the auspices of the United Nations , which was ratified by the vast majority of UN member nations.
In addition, the right to child support, as well as specific implementation and enforcement measures, has been recognized by various other international entities, including the Council of Europe , the European Union and the Hague Conference .
Within individual countries, examples of legislation pertaining to, and establishing guidelines for, the implementation and collection of child maintenance include the 1975 Family Law Act ( Australia ), the Child Support Act (United Kingdom) and the Maintenance and Affiliation Act (Fiji) Child support in the United States , 45 C.F.R. 302.56 requires each state to establish and publish a Guideline that is presumptively (but rebuttably) correct, and Review the Guideline, at a minimum, every four (4) years.  Child support laws and obligations are known to be recognized in a vast majority of world nations, including the majority of countries in Europe, North America and Australasia, as well as many in Africa, Asia and South America.
The Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF, in French Forces Rwandaises de Défense) is the national army of Rwanda .
Largely composed of former Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) fighters, it comprises (a) The High Command Council of the Rwanda Defence Forces; (b) the General Staff of the Rwanda Defence Forces; (c) the Rwanda Land Force; (d) the Rwanda Air Force; and (e) specialised units.
In November 2002 Emmanuel Habyarimana was removed from his post as Minister of Defence, which government spokesperson Joseph Bideri attributed to his "extreme pro-Hutu" views.
Habyarimana was replaced by Marcel Gatsinzi .
After the successful conquest of the country in 1994 in the aftermath of the Rwandan Genocide , the Rwandan Patriotic Front decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and a military division, which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state in two distinct and independent institutions.
Defence spending continues to represent an important share of the national budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , and lingering concerns about Uganda 's intentions towards its former ally.
The government has launched an ambitious plan to demobilize thousands of soldiers. During the First and Second Congo War, the RPF committed wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according the United Nations Mapping Report.
United Nations Mapping Report: DRC 1993-2003 Four serving army officers of the Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) were indicted in June 2008 for crimes committed during the 1994 genocide.
Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American clergyman, activist, and leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement .
He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience .
King has become a national icon in the history of American progressivism .  A Baptist minister, King became a civil rights activist early in his career.
He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president.
With the SCLC, King led an unsuccessful struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia , in 1962, and organized nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama , that attracted national attention following television news coverage of the brutal police response.
King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington , where he delivered his " I Have a Dream " speech.
There, he established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history.
He also established his reputation as a radical, and became an object of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's COINTELPRO for the rest of his life.
FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and on one occasion, mailed King a threatening anonymous letter that he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.
On October 14, 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolence .
In 1965, he and the SCLC helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches and the following year, he took the movement north to Chicago .
In the final years of his life, King expanded his focus to include poverty and the Vietnam War , alienating many of his liberal allies with a 1967 speech titled "Beyond Vietnam".
King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., called the Poor People's Campaign .
King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee .
His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities .
Allegations that James Earl Ray , the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting, and the jury of a 1999 civil trial found Loyd Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy against King.
King was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986.
Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor.
A memorial statue on the National Mall was opened to the public in 2011.
Greenwich Village, often referred to in New York as simply "the Village", is a largely residential neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan in New York City.
A large majority of the district is home to upper middle class families. Greenwich Village, however, was known in the late 19th to mid 20th centuries as an artists' haven, the bohemian capital, and the East Coast birthplace of the Beat movement .
What provided the initial attractive character of the community eventually contributed to its gentrification and commercialization.
The name of the village is Anglicized from the Dutch name Greenwijck, meaning "Pine District", into Greenwich , a borough of London .

Top right: Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who was responsible for initiatives and programs collectively known as the New Deal.
Bottom: A public mural from one of the artists employed by the New Deal.
The New Deal was a series of economic programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1936.
They involved presidential executive orders or laws passed by Congress during the first term of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt .
The programs were in response to the Great Depression , and focused on what historians call the "3 Rs": Relief, Recovery, and Reform.
That is Relief for the unemployed and poor; Recovery of the economy to normal levels; and Reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression.
The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of nine Presidential terms from 1933 to 1969), with its base in liberal ideas, the white South, traditional Democrats, big city machines, and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities.
The Republicans were split, with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an enemy of business and growth, and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient.
The realignment crystallized into the New Deal Coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s, while the opposition Conservative Coalition largely controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.
By 1936 the term "liberal" typically was used for supporters of the New Deal, and " conservative " for its opponents.
From 1934 to 1938, Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavours by a “pro- spender” majority in Congress (drawn from two-party, competitive, non- machine, Progressive, and Left party districts).
As noted by Alexander Hicks, “Roosevelt, backed by rare, non- Southern Democrat majorities — 270 non-Southern Democrat representatives and 71 non-Southern Democrat senators — spelled Second New Deal reform.” Many historians distinguish between a "First New Deal" (1933–34) and a "Second New Deal" (1935–38), with the second one more liberal and more controversial.
The "First New Deal" (1933–34) dealt with diverse groups, from banking and railroads to industry and farming, all of which demanded help for economic survival.
The Federal Emergency Relief Administration , for instance, provided $500 million for relief operations by states and cities, while the short-lived CWA ( Civil Works Administration ) gave localities money to operate make-work projects in 1933-34.
The " Second New Deal " in 1935–38 included the Wagner Act to promote labor unions, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) relief program (which made the federal government by far the largest single employer in the nation), the Social Security Act , and new programs to aid tenant farmers and migrant workers. The final major items of New Deal legislation were the creation of the United States Housing Authority and Farm Security Administration , both in 1937, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 , which set maximum hours and minimum wages for most categories of workers.
The economic downturn of 1937–38, and the bitter split between the AFL and CIO labor unions led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938.
Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal Conservative Coalition.
By 1942–43 they shut down relief programs such as the WPA and CCC and blocked major liberal proposals.
Roosevelt himself turned his attention to the war effort, and won reelection in 1940 and 1944.
The Supreme Court declared the National Recovery Administration (NRA) and the first version of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) unconstitutional, however the AAA was rewritten and then upheld.
As the first Republican president elected after FDR, Dwight D.
Eisenhower (1953– 61) left the New Deal largely intact, even expanding it in some areas.
In the 1960s, Lyndon B.
Johnson 's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs, which Republican Richard M.
Nixon generally retained.
After 1974, however, the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support.
The New Deal regulation of banking ( Glass–Steagall Act ) was suspended in the 1990s.
Many New Deal programs remain active, with some still operating under the original names, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The largest programs still in existence today are the Social Security System and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Terah is also a place, Terah (Exodus) Terah or Térach () is a biblical figure in the book of Genesis , son of Nahor, son of Serug and father of the Patriarch Abraham , all descendants of Shem 's son Arpachshad .
Terah is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and in the New Testament .
The Ford Model T ( colloquially known as the Tin Lizzie, T‐Model Ford, 'Model T Ford', or T) is an automobile that was produced by Henry Ford 's Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908 to May 27, 1927.
It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile , the car that opened travel to the common middle- class American ; some of this was because of Ford's innovations, including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting.
The Ford Model T was named the world's most influential car of the 20th century in an international poll.
The Model T set 1908 as the historic year that the automobile became popular.
The first production Model T was produced on August 12, 1908 and left the factory on September 27, 1908, at the Piquette Plant in Detroit, Michigan .
On May 26, 1927, Henry Ford watched the 15 millionth Model T Ford roll off the assembly line at his factory in Highland Park, Michigan .
There were several cars produced or prototyped by Henry Ford from the founding of the company in 1903 until the Model T came along.
Although he started with the Model A , there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes.
The production model immediately before the Model T was the Model S , an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). Company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted to start all over again with the letter A.
The Model T was the first automobile mass produced on moving assembly lines with completely interchangeable parts , marketed to the middle class .
Henry Ford said of the vehicle: I will build a car for the great multitude. 0 Q2788 when was the model t made D2592 Ford Model T D2592-14 It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for the individual to run and care for. 0 Q2788 when was the model t made D2592 Ford Model T D2592-15 It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. 0 Q2788 when was the model t made D2592 Ford Model T D2592-16 But it will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one – and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces.
Celebration is a census-designated place (CDP) and a master-planned community in Osceola County , Florida , United States , located near Walt Disney World Resort and originally developed by The Walt Disney Company .
As part of the Orlando – Kissimmee Metropolitan Statistical Area , Celebration's population was 7,427 at the 2010 census .
Subsequent to founding Celebration, Disney followed its plans to divest most of its control of the town.
Several Disney business units continue to occupy the town's office buildings, and two utility companies, Smart City Telecom and Reedy Creek Energy Services , both operated from Walt Disney World, provide services to the town.
The town itself remains directly connected to the Walt Disney World resorts via one of its primary streets, World Drive, which begins near the Magic Kingdom .
Downtown Celebration's post office was designed by Michael Graves , the adjacent Welcome Center is by Philip Johnson and the Celebration Health building by Robert A.
M.
Stern .
Other nearby buildings are designed by well known architects including: Charles Moore (Preview Center), Graham Gund (Bohemian Hotel), Cesar Pelli (movie theatre), Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (SunTrust Bank).
Response to Celebration has ranged from an early visitor who said it resembled the too-perfect town of The Stepford Wives , to those who see Celebration as a return to small-town values with walkable and safe communities.
La Palma () is the most north-westerly of the Canary Islands .
La Palma has an area of 706 km2 making it the fifth largest of the seven main Canary Islands.
The total population is about 86,000, of which 18,000 (2003 data) live in the capital, Santa Cruz de la Palma and about 20,000 (2004 data) in Los Llanos de Aridane .
Santa Cruz de La Palma (the island's main port) retains many elegant 17th- and 18th-century houses, and produces high-quality handmade cigars made from locally grown tobacco.
In 1815, the German geologist Leopold von Buch visited the Canary Islands.
It was as a result of his visit to La Palma and Tenerife where he visited the Las Cañadas and Taburiente calderas, that the Spanish word for cauldron - " Caldera " - was introduced into the English language geological vocabulary.
La Palma has "Sister City" status with El Dorado Hills, California, United States. The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire was one of the most significant events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas .
The campaign began in February 1519, and was declared victorious on August 13, 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Hernán Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured Tenochtitlan , the capital of the Aztec Empire .
Moctezuma was convinced that Hernan Cortes was a god, as the Spanish brought horses and guns, which the Aztecs had never seen before.
During the campaign, Cortés was offered support from a number of tributaries and rivals of the Aztecs , including the Totonacs , and the Tlaxcaltecas .
In their advance, the allies were tricked and ambushed several times by the peoples they encountered.
After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II to his visit, Cortés arrived in Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519, where he took up residence welcomed by Moctezuma.
When news reached Cortés of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the Totonacs in Veracruz , he took Moctezuma captive in his own palace and ruled through him for months.
After the massacre at the Main Temple of Tenochtitlan and a rebellion by the population of the city, Cortés and his men had to fight their way out of the capital city during the Noche Triste in June, 1520.
However, the Spanish and Tlaxcalans would return with reinforcements and a siege that led to the fall of Tenochtitlan a year later.
The collapse of the Aztec Empire was a major milestone in the formation of New Spain, which would not be formalized by the Spanish Crown until 1535 A.D.
The Spanish claimed the Aztec empire as ' New Spain '.
Oil Platform P-51 off the Brazilian coast is a semi-submersible platform .
Oil platform Mittelplate in the North sea An oil platform, (offshore platform or colloquially oil rig) is a large structure with facilities to drill wells, to extract and process oil and natural gas , and to temporarily store product until it can be brought to shore for refining and marketing.
In many cases, the platform contains facilities to house the workforce as well.
Depending on the circumstances, the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor, may consist of an artificial island , or may float .
Remote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by umbilical connections.
These subsea solutions may consist of one or more subsea wells, or of one or more manifold centres for multiple wells.
Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician and diplomat who was the 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, serving under President Barack Obama .
She was previously a United States Senator for New York from 2001 to 2009.
As the wife of President Bill Clinton , she was also the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001.
In the 2008 election , Clinton was a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination .
A native of Illinois , Hillary Rodham first attracted national attention in 1969 for her remarks as the first student commencement speaker at Wellesley College .
She embarked on a career in law after receiving her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1973.
Following a stint as a Congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas in 1974 and married Bill Clinton in 1975. Rodham cofounded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families in 1977 and became the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978.
Named the first female partner at Rose Law Firm in 1979, she was twice listed as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America.
As First Lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992 with husband Bill as governor, she successfully led a task force to reform Arkansas's education system.
During that time, she was a member of the board of directors of Wal-Mart Stores and several other corporations.
In 1994, as First Lady of the United States, her major initiative, the Clinton health care plan , failed to gain approval from the U.S.
Congress.
However, in 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program , the Adoption and Safe Families Act , and the Foster Care Independence Act .
Her years as First Lady drew a polarized response from the American public.
The only First Lady to have been subpoenaed , she testified before a federal grand jury in 1996 due to the Whitewater controversy , but was never charged with wrongdoing in this or several other investigations during her husband's administration .
The state of her marriage was the subject of considerable speculation following the Lewinsky scandal in 1998.
After moving to the state of New York, Clinton was elected as a U.S.
Senator in 2000.
That election marked the first time an American First Lady had run for public office; Clinton was also the first female senator to represent the state.
In the Senate, she initially supported the Bush administration on some foreign policy issues, including a vote for the Iraq War Resolution .
She subsequently opposed the administration on its conduct of the war in Iraq and on most domestic issues.
Senator Clinton was reelected by a wide margin in 2006 .
In the 2008 presidential nomination race , Hillary Clinton won more primaries and delegates than any other female candidate in American history, but narrowly lost to Illinois Senator Barack Obama .
Obama went on to win the election and appoint Clinton as Secretary of State; she became the first former First Lady to serve in a president's cabinet .
She was at the forefront of the U.S. response to the Arab Spring , including advocating the military intervention in Libya .
Clinton introduced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review process to the State Department, seeking to maximize departmental effectiveness and promote the empowerment of women worldwide, and used " smart power " as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values in the world.
She is the most widely traveled secretary during her time in office and also championed the use of social media in getting the U.S. message out.

Artist's impression of a major impact event.
The collision between a planet and an asteroid a few kilometers in diameter may release as much energy as several million nuclear weapons detonating simultaneously.
An impact event is the collision of an asteroid , comet , meteoroid , or other celestial object with another celestial object such as Earth .
Throughout recorded history, hundreds of minor impact events (and exploding bolides ) have been reported, with some occurrences causing deaths, injuries, property damage or other significant localised consequences.
There have also been major impact events throughout the Earth's history which severely disrupted the environment and caused mass extinctions . Impact craters are the result of impact events on solid objects and as the dominant landforms on many of the System's solid objects and provide the most solid evidence of prehistoric events.
Notable impact events include the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , which occurred 65 million years ago and led to the demise of the dinosaurs .
That event is associated with a large meteorite impact that created the Chicxulub crater around the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico.
One of the best-known recorded impacts in modern times was the Tunguska event , which occurred in Siberia , Russia , in 1908.
The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor event is the only known such event to result in a large number of casualties, and the Chelyabinsk meteor is the largest recorded object to have encountered the Earth since the Tunguska event.
The most notable non-terrestrial event is the Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 impact, which provided the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects, when the comet broke apart and collided with Jupiter in July 1994.
Impact events have been a plot and background element in science fiction since knowledge of real impacts became established in the scientific mainstream.
First two pages of Poe's handwritten manuscript for "The Bells", 1848 The Bells" is a heavily onomatopoeic poem by Edgar Allan Poe which was not published until after his death in 1849. 0 Q2815 Who Are the Characters in the poem Bells D2615 The Bells D2615-2 It is perhaps best known for the diacopic use of the word "bells.
The poem has four parts to it; each part becomes darker and darker as the poem progresses from "the jingling and the tinkling" of the bells in part 1 to the "moaning and the groaning" of the bells in part 4.
Sergeant Major Daniel Joseph "Dan" Daly (November 11, 1873 – April 27, 1937) was a United States Marine and one of only nineteen men (including seven Marines) to have received the Medal of Honor twice .
Of the Marines who are double recipients, only Daly and Major General Smedley Butler received their Medals of Honor for two, separate actions.
Daly is said to have yelled, "Come on, you sons of bitches!
Do you want to live forever?" to the men in his company prior to charging the Germans during the Battle of Belleau Wood in World War I ; Daly claimed he said, "For Christ's sake men—come on!
Do you want to live forever?" Maj.
Gen.
Smedley Butler described Daly as, "The fightin'est Marine I ever knew!" Daly reportedly was offered an officer's commission twice to which he responded that he would rather be, "...an outstanding sergeant than just another officer." Ted Williams (born September 22, 1957) is an American voice-over artist .

Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, DBE (née Miller; 15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976) was a British crime writer of novels, short stories, and plays.
She also wrote six romances under the name Mary Westmacott, but she is best remembered for the 66 detective novels and more than 15 short story collections she wrote under her own name, most of which revolve around the investigations of such characters as Hercule Poirot , Miss Jane Marple and Tommy and Tuppence .
She also wrote the world's longest- running play, The Mousetrap .
Born to a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay , Devon , Christie served in a hospital during the First World War , before marrying and starting a family in London.
Although initially unsuccessful at getting her work published, in 1920, The Bodley Head press published her novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles , featuring the character of Poirot .
This launched her literary career.
According to the Guinness Book of World Records , Christie is the best- selling novelist of all time.
Her novels have sold roughly 4 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works rank third, after those of William Shakespeare and the Bible , as the world's most-widely published books.
According to Index Translationum , Christie is the most-translated individual author, and her books have been translated into at least 103 languages.
And Then There Were None is Christie's best-selling novel with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever, and one of the best-selling books of all time.
In 1971, she was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace .
Christie's stage play The Mousetrap holds the record for the longest initial run: it opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in London on 25 November 1952 and as of 2012 is still running after more than 25,000 performances.
In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America 's highest honour, the Grand Master Award , and in the same year Witness for the Prosecution was given an Edgar Award by the MWA for Best Play.
Many of her books and short stories have been filmed, and many have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics.
The Stanley Cup is an ice hockey club trophy , awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoffs champion at the conclusion of the Stanley Cup Finals .
It was donated by the Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley of Preston in 1892, and is the oldest professional sports trophy in North America.
Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy started out as an award for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada .
In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Stanley Cup.
After a series of league mergers and folds, it became the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926.
The Cup later became the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947. Since the 1914–15 season, the trophy has been won a combined 95 times by 18 teams now active in the NHL and five defunct teams.
Prior to that, the challenge cup was held by nine different teams.
The Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times and made the finals an additional ten times.
There were two years when the Stanley Cup was not awarded: 1919 , because of the Spanish flu epidemic , and 2005 , because of the NHL lockout.
A woman casts her vote in the second round of the French presidential election of 2007 Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives.
Democracy allows eligible citizens to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws .
It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self- determination .
The term originates from the Greek (') "rule of the people", which was coined from δῆμος (dêmos) "people" and κράτος (kratos) "power" or "rule" in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems then existing in Greek city- states , notably Athens ; the term is an antonym to (aristocratie) "rule of an elite".
While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically.
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation.
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents.
A democratic government contrasts to forms of government where power is either held by one, as in a monarchy , or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy .
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements.
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution .
Several variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will.
One form of democracy is direct democracy , in which all eligible citizens have direct and active participation in the decision making of the government.
In most modern democracies, the whole body of all eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called representative democracy .
The concept of representative democracy arose largely from ideas and institutions that developed during the European Middle Ages , the Age of Enlightenment , and the American and French Revolutions .
For more information on the distinct origin of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, see Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences The Nobel Prize (, Swedish definite form, singular: Nobelpriset; Norwegian : Nobelprisen) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Scandinavian committees in recognition of cultural and/or scientific advances.
The will of the Swedish philanthropist inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895.
The prizes in Physics , Chemistry , Physiology or Medicine , Literature , and Peace were first awarded in 1901.
The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo , Norway, while the other prizes are awarded in Stockholm , Sweden.
The Nobel Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature, medicine, physics, chemistry, peace, and economics.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences; the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature; and the Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by a Swedish organisation but by the Norwegian Nobel Committee .
The various prizes are awarded yearly.
Each recipient, or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma and a sum of money, which is decided by the Nobel Foundation . , each prize was worth 8 million SEK (c. , €0.93 million).
The prize is not awarded posthumously; however, if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it, the prize may still be presented.
Though the average number of laureates per prize increased substantially during the 20th century, a prize may not be shared among more than three people.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a 2011 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line .
First released on June 23, 2011, it is the third installment of the live-action Transformers film series .
Like its predecessors, Transformers and , Transformers: Dark of the Moon is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg .
The film's story is set three years after the events of the second film, with the Autobots , during their collaboration with the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force, discovering a hidden alien technology in possession of humans, which had been found by Apollo 11 on the Moon 42 years earlier.
However, the Decepticons unveil a plan to use the technology to enslave humanity in order to bring back Cybertron , the home planet of the Transformers.
Shia LaBeouf , Josh Duhamel , Tyrese Gibson , and John Turturro reprised their starring roles, with Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving returning as the voices of Optimus Prime and Megatron , and Kevin Dunn and Julie White reprising their roles as the parents of the protagonist, Sam Witwicky.
English model Rosie Huntington- Whiteley replaced Megan Fox as the lead female character; the cast also saw the additions of Patrick Dempsey , John Malkovich , Ken Jeong , and Frances McDormand .
The film also welcomed Keith Szarabajka , Ron Bottitta , John DiMaggio , George Coe , Francesco Quinn , James Remar , Greg Berg , and veteran science-fiction actor Leonard Nimoy to the voice cast.
The script was written by Ehren Kruger , who also collaborated on the narrative of the second film of the series.
Dark of the Moon employed both regular 35mm film cameras and specially- developed 3-D cameras, with filming locations in Chicago , Florida , Indiana , Moscow , and Washington, D.C. . The film was rendered specifically for 3- D, and the visual effects involved more complex robots which took longer to render.
In May 2011, it was announced that Paramount Pictures would move Transformers: Dark of the Moon release date of July 1 to June 29 in order to monitor an early response to footage.
Exclusive early premieres in select 3-D and IMAX theaters took place June 28, 2011, one night before worldwide release in 2-D and 3-D (including IMAX 3D ) formats—each featuring Dolby Surround 7.1 sound.
Critical reception of the film was mixed to negative, with several critics calling it better than Revenge of the Fallen and praising the film's visuals and 3-D action sequences, but criticizing its writing, acting, and length.
Dark of the Moon grossed US$1 .12 billion worldwide, and is currently the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time , the second-highest-grossing film of 2011 (behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 ), the highest-grossing film in the Transformers series, and the tenth film to gross over $1 billion.
Like the first film, it was nominated for Best Visual Effects , Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing at the 84th Academy Awards .
A sequel to the film, directed once again by Michael Bay, is scheduled for release on June 27, 2014.
The Scenic Railway at Luna Park, Melbourne , is the world's oldest continually-operating roller coaster, built in 1912.
Video from inside a roller coaster car (Xpress, Walibi Holland , The Netherlands ) The roller coaster is a popular amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks .
LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood , but this patent is considerably later than the "Russian mountains" described below.
In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns , sometimes with one or more inversions (such as vertical loops ) that briefly turn the rider upside down.
The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.
Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.
Two or more cars hooked together are called a train .
Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters , run with single cars.
John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK, was the 35th President of the United States , serving from 1961 until his death in 1963.
After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific , Kennedy represented Massachusetts' 11th congressional district in the U.S.
House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat .
Thereafter, he served in the U.S.
Senate from 1953 until 1960.
Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election .
At 43 years of age, he is the youngest to have been elected to the office, the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt ), and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president.
A Catholic , Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president, and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize . Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the building of the Berlin Wall , the Space Race , the African- American Civil Rights Movement , and early stages of the Vietnam War .
Therein, Kennedy increased the number of military advisers, special operation forces, and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia.
The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government.
It involved certain forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents.
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas , Texas.
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later, before a trial could take place.
The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin.
However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy .
However, ABC News in their investigation, The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy, confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission; having concluded Oswald acted alone.
Kennedy's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970.
Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light.
Details of Kennedy's health problems in which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s.
Although initially kept secret from the general public, reports of Kennedy's philandering have garnered much press.
Kennedy ranks highly in public opinion ratings of U.S. presidents .
Bowers v.
Hardwick, , is a United States Supreme Court decision, overturned in 2003, that upheld, in a 5-4 ruling, the constitutionality of a Georgia sodomy law criminalizing oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults when applied to homosexuals.
The majority opinion, written by Justice Byron White , argued that the Constitution did not confer "a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy." A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger cited the "ancient roots" of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting William Blackstone 's description of homosexual sex as an "infamous crime against nature", worse than rape, and "a crime not fit to be named." Burger concluded: "To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching." Justice Lewis F.
Powell later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.
The dissent, authored by Harry Blackmun , framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy.
Blackmun's dissent accused the Court of an "almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity" and an "overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases." In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: "That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine." Seventeen years after Bowers v.
Hardwick, the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in Lawrence v.
Texas , 539 U.S. 558 (2003), and held that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional.
In overruling Bowers v.
Hardwick, the Court stated that "Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today." The colon is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates .
It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora- aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs.
Unlike the small intestine , the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients.
However, the colon does absorb water, sodium and some fat soluble vitamins.
In mammals , the colon consists of four sections: the ascending colon , the transverse colon , the descending colon , and the sigmoid colon (the proximal colon usually refers to the ascending colon and transverse colon).
The cecum , colon, rectum and anal canal make up the large intestine .
Martin Luther (; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German monk , former Catholic priest , professor of theology and seminal figure of a reform movement in sixteenth century Christianity , subsequently known as the Protestant Reformation .
He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money.
He confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel with his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517.
His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.
Luther taught that salvation is not earned by good deeds but received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin.
His theology challenged the authority of the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood .
Those who identify with Luther's teachings are called Lutherans .
His translation of the Bible into the vernacular (instead of Latin ) made it more accessible, which had a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture.
It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the writing of an English translation, the King James Bible .
His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches.
His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant priests to marry.
In his later years, in deteriorating health, Luther became increasingly antisemitic , writing that Jewish homes should be destroyed, their synagogues burned, money confiscated and liberty curtailed.
These statements have contributed to his controversial status.
Wellness is generally used to mean a healthy balance of the mind, body and spirit that results in an overall feeling of well-being .
It has been used in the context of alternative medicine since Halbert L.
Dunn, M.D. , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s. The modern concept of wellness did not, however, become popular until the 1970s.
The term has been defined by the Wisconsin-based National Wellness Institute as an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a more successful existence.
URL_http This is consistent with a shift in focus away from illness in viewing human health, typical of contexts where the term wellness is used.
In other words, wellness is a view of health that emphasizes the state of the entire being and its ongoing development.
The phrase can also be seen as an analogue to the medical term " homeostasis ".
Wellness can also be described as "the constant, conscious pursuit of living life to its fullest potential." Halbert L.
Dunn, M.D. , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s, based on a series of lectures at a Unitarian Universalist Church in Arlington, Virginia, in the United States.
Dunn (196, p. 4) defined wellness as "an integrated method of functioning which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable.
It requires that the individual maintain a continuum of balance and purposeful direction within the environment where he is functioning." He also stated that "wellness is a direction in progress toward an ever- higher potential of functioning" (p. 6).
Alternative approaches to wellness are often denoted by the use of two different phrases: health and wellness, and wellness programs.
These kinds of wellness programs offer alternative medicine techniques to improve wellness.
Whether these techniques actually improve physical health is controversial and a subject of much debate.
James Randi and the James Randi Educational Foundation are outspoken critics of this alternative new age concept of wellness.
The behaviors in the pursuit of wellness often include many health related practices, such as natural therapies .
Wellness, as a luxury pursuit, is found obviously in the more affluent societies because it involves managing the body state after the basic needs of food, shelter and basic medical care have already been met.
Many of the practices applied in the pursuit of wellness, in fact, are aimed at controlling the side effects of affluence, such as obesity and inactivity.
Wellness grew as a popular concept starting in the 19th century, just as the middle class began emerging in the industrialized world, and a time when a newly prosperous public had the time and the resources to pursue wellness and other forms of self-improvement.

St. Isidore of Seville , a 7th century Doctor of the Church, depicted by Murillo (c. 1628) with a book, common iconographical object for a doctor. Doctor of the Church ( Latin doctor, teacher, from Latin docere, to teach) is a title given by a variety of Christian churches to individuals whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine.
A thermite reaction using iron(III) oxide.
The sparks flying outwards are globules of molten iron trailing smoke in their wake.
Video demonstrating a chemical reaction.
A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another.
Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms , with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation .
Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may both occur.
The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents .
Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change , and they yield one or more products , which usually have properties different from the reactants.
Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions , and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism .
Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations , which graphically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.
Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration, and rapid reactions are often described as spontaneous , requiring no input of extra energy other than thermal energy.
Non-spontaneous reactions run so slowly that they are considered to require the input of some type of additional energy (such as extra heat, light or electricity) in order to proceed to completion ( chemical equilibrium ) at human time scales.
Different chemical reactions are used in combinations during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product.
In biochemistry , a similar series of chemical reactions form metabolic pathways .
These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes .
These enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions may be performed at the temperatures and concentrations present within a cell .
The general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to non- chemical reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions , radioactive decays , and reactions between elementary particles as described by quantum field theory .
Mammoth Cave National Park is a U.S.
National Park in central Kentucky , encompassing portions of Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system known in the world .  The official name of the system is the Mammoth-Flint Ridge Cave System for the ridge under which the cave has formed.
The park was established as a national park on July 1, 1941.
It became a World Heritage Site on October 27, 1981, and an international Biosphere Reserve on September 26, 1990.
The park's are located primarily in Edmonson County, Kentucky , with small areas extending eastward into Hart County and Barren County . It is centered around the Green River , with a tributary , the Nolin River , feeding into the Green just inside the park.
With of passageways it is by far the world's longest known cave system, being well over twice as long as the second-longest cave system, South Dakota 's Jewel Cave , which has just over of known passageways.
The moons of Saturn (also known as the natural satellites of Saturn) are numerous and diverse ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous Titan which is larger than the planet Mercury .
Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers.
Saturn has seven moons that are large enough to be ellipsoidal due to having planetary mass , as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own.
Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second- largest moon in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape including hydrocarbon lakes and dry river networks; and Enceladus , which emits jets of gas and dust and may harbor liquid water under its south pole region.
Twenty-four of Saturn's moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane.
They include the seven major satellites, four small moons which exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons, two mutually co- orbital moons and two moons which act as shepherds of Saturn's F Ring .
Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings.
The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan.
The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the A Ring , within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus.
The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn .
The remaining 38, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits are much farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde .
These moons are probably captured minor planets , or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families .  The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit , Norse , and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies.
The largest of the irregular moons is Phoebe , the ninth moon of Saturn, and was discovered at the end of the 19th century.
The rings of Saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to hundreds of meters, each of which is on its own orbit about the planet.
Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons.
At least 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.
A cannon is any piece of artillery that uses gunpowder or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile.
Cannon vary in caliber , range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed.
The plural of cannon is also cannon, though more commonly in America, cannons.
In the modern era, the term cannon has fallen out of common usage, replaced by "guns" or "artillery" if not a more specific term such as "mortar" or "howitzer".
In aviation, cannon generally describes weapons firing bullets larger than 0.5 inches (12.7 mm) in diameter.
First used in China , cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery, and over time replaced siege engines —among other forms of aging weaponry—on the battlefield.
In the Middle East, the first use of the hand cannon is argued to be during the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut between the Mamluks and Mongols .
The first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia in the 11 and 12th centuries, and English cannon were first deployed in the Hundred Years' War , at the Battle of Crécy , in 1346.
On the African continent , the cannon was first used by the Somali Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate in his conquest of Ethiopia in 1529.
It was during this period, the Middle Ages , that cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry and siege roles.
After the Middle Ages most large cannon were abandoned in favor of greater numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces.  In addition, new technologies and tactics were developed, making most defences obsolete; this led to the construction of star forts , specifically designed to withstand artillery bombardment though these too (along with the Martello Tower ) would find themselves rendered obsolete when explosive and armour piercing rounds made even these types of fortifications vulnerable.
Cannon also transformed naval warfare in the early modern period , as European navies took advantage of their firepower.
As rifling became commonplace, the accuracy and destructive power of cannon was significantly increased, and they became deadlier than ever, both to infantry who belatedly had to adopt different tactics, and to ships, which had to be armoured.
In World War I , the majority of combat fatalities were caused by artillery; they were also used widely in World War II . Most modern cannon are similar to those used in the Second World War, although the importance of the larger caliber weapons has declined with the development of missiles .
Twitter is an online social networking service and microblogging service that enables its users to send and read text- based messages of up to 140 characters , known as "tweets".
Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey and by July, the social networking site was launched.
The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity, with over 500 million registered users as of 2012, generating over 340 million tweets daily and handling over 1.6 billion search queries per day.
Since its launch, Twitter has become one of the ten most visited websites on the Internet, and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet ." Unregistered users can read tweets, while registered users can post tweets through the website interface, SMS, or a range of apps for mobile devices.
Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco , with additional servers and offices in New York City , Boston , and San Antonio .
The OpenID logo OpenID is an open standard that allows users to be authenticated by certain co- operating sites (known as Relying Parties or RP) using a third party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc systems and allowing users to consolidate their digital identities .
Users may create accounts with their preferred OpenID identity providers , and then use those accounts as the basis for signing on to any website which accepts OpenID authentication.
The OpenID standard provides a framework for the communication that must take place between the identity provider and the OpenID acceptor (the "relying party").
An extension to the standard (the OpenID Attribute Exchange) facilitates the transfer of user attributes, such as name and gender, from the OpenID identity provider to the relying party (each relying party may request a different set of attributes, depending on its requirements).
The OpenID protocol does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a user's identity.
Moreover, neither services nor the OpenID standard may mandate a specific means by which to authenticate users, allowing for approaches ranging from the common (such as passwords) to the novel (such as smart cards or biometrics ).
The term OpenID may also refer to an identifier as specified in the OpenID standard; these identifiers take the form of a unique URI , and are managed by some 'OpenID provider' that handles authentication.
OpenID authentication is now used and provided by several large websites.
Providers include Google , Yahoo! , PayPal , BBC , AOL , LiveJournal , MySpace , IBM , Steam , Sherdog , Orange and VeriSign .
Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglyceride .
It is a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels , a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, caused largely by the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low-density lipoproteins (LDL, plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides ) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (see apoA-1 Milano ).
It is commonly referred to as a hardening or furring of the arteries.
It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries.
The atheromatous plaque is divided into three distinct components: The atheroma ("lump of gruel," from ἀθήρα, athera, gruel in Greek), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the lumen of the artery Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals Calcification at the outer base of older/more advanced lesions .
The following terms are similar, yet distinct, in both spelling and meaning, and can be easily confused: arteriosclerosis , arteriolosclerosis , and atherosclerosis.
Arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries (from the Greek arteria , meaning artery, and , meaning hardening); arteriolosclerosis is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of arterioles (small arteries); atherosclerosis is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an atheromatous plaque.
The term atherogenic is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable).
The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells , while, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap ) is usually weak and prone to rupture.
Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen.
Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (i.e. coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism (i.e.
Stroke is often caused by thrombus formation in the carotid arteries).
Apart from thromboembolism , chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen.
Interestingly, chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient resulting in ischemia .
These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative.
Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque ), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately 5 minutes.
This catastrophic event is called an infarction .
One of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery , causing myocardial infarction (a heart attack).
The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke .
Another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs, typically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots .
Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree, but mostly larger, high-pressure vessels such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries.
These are termed " clinically silent " because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help, or when they do, physicians do not recognize what has happened.
Depiction of the classical model of the Triangular trade.
Triangular trade, or triangle trade, is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions.
Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has export commodities that are not required in the region from which its major imports come.
Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying trade imbalances between the above regions.
The particular routes were historically also shaped by the powerful influence of winds and currents during the age of sail .
For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe it was much easier to sail westwards after first going south of 30 N latitude and reaching the so-called " trade winds "; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the North American mainland .
Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the Gulf Stream in a northeasterly direction using the westerlies .
A similar triangle to this, called the volta do mar lago was already being used by the Portuguese, before Columbus' voyage, to sail to the Canary Island and the Azores . Columbus simply expanded the triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.
USS John F.
Kennedy (CV-67) (formerly CVA-67) is the only ship of her class, a subclass of the Kitty Hawk-class aircraft carrier , and the last conventionally powered carrier built for the United States Navy .
The ship is named after the 35th President of the United States, John F.
Kennedy , and is nicknamed "Big John." Kennedy was originally designated a CVA ( fixed wing attack carrier); however, the designation was changed to CV to denote that the ship was capable of anti-submarine warfare , making her an all-purpose carrier.
After nearly 40 years of service in the United States Navy, Kennedy was officially decommissioned on 1 August 2007.
She is berthed at the NAVSEA Inactive Ships On-site Maintenance facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania .
She is available for donation as a museum and memorial to a qualified organization.
The name has been adopted by the future Gerald R.
Ford-class aircraft carrier John F.
Kennedy (CVN-79) .

As an IP core business, ARM Holdings itself does not manufacture its own electronic chips, but licenses its designs to other semiconductor manufacturers.
ARM-based processors and systems on a chip include the Qualcomm Snapdragon , nVidia Tegra , Marvell Xscale and Texas Instruments OMAP , as well as ARM's Cortex series and Apple System on Chips (used in its iPhones ).
The name was originally an acronym for Acorn RISC Machine and subsequently, after the name Acorn was dropped, Advanced RISC Machine.
Using a RISC based approach to computer design, ARM processors require significantly fewer transistors than processors that would typically be found in a traditional computer.
The benefits of this approach are lower costs, less heat, and less power usage, traits that are desirable for use in light, portable, battery-powered devices such as smart phones and tablet computers.
The reduced complexity and simpler design allows companies to build a low- energy system on a chip for an embedded system incorporating memory, interfaces, radios, etc.
The earliest example was the Apple Newton tablet but this same approach is still used in the Apple A4 and A5 chips in the iPad .
ARM periodically releases updates to its core — currently ARMv7 and ARMv8 — which chip manufacturers can then license and use for their own devices.
Variants are available for each of these to include or exclude optional capabilities. Current versions use 32-bit instructions with 32-bit address space, but accommodates 16-bit instructions for economy and can also handle Java bytecodes which use 32-bit addresses.
More recently, ARM architecture has included 64-bit versions.
In 2012 AMD announced that in 2014 it would start producing server chips based on the 64-bit ARM core.
Phyllophaga (genus) , a genus of beetles in the subfamily Melolonthinae of the family Scarabaeidae, also known as June bugs or June Beetles.
The Green June beetle ( Cotinis nitida ), of the southeastern United States The Ten-lined June beetle (Polyphylla decemlineata), of the western United States and Canada The Figeater beetle (Cotinis mutabilis), of the western and southwestern United States The European chafer (Rhizotrogus majalis/Amphimallon majalis), a beetle native to continental Europe, but now also in North America A broodmare is a mare used for breeding.
A horse's female parent is known as its dam.
An adult male horse is called a stallion , or, if castrated , a gelding .
Occasionally the term "horse" is used in a restrictive sense to designate only a male horse.
