With all the fawning end-of-the-year kudos currently circulating, it’s easy to forget that a
sizable number of actual bad movies came out in 2012. Well, consider this a refresher! From
failed blockbuster tentpoles (”Battleship”) to would-be hilarious comedies (“The Watch”) to
lame scare-challenged horror flicks (“The Apparition”) to...uh, well, pretty much anything
involving Mr. Tyler Perry, there’s no doubt that the last 366 days have come with a heaping
helping of truly heinous cinematic stinkers. So what better time for an accounting of the
year’s most outrageous big-screen abominations than on the eve of the coming apocalypse?
