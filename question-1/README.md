## Question 1 Folder Overview

For our sentence boundary detection question they key points to note in this folder are:

- The script with outputs is ran in the **assignment1-q1.ipynb** file.
- I used two different text files to test it's robustness.
- There are test.txt and jeop.txt.
- Test.txt contains the sample text from the question asked.
- Jeop.txt contains the test file for the well-known jeopardy questions dataset.
This contains over 4,000 questions asked for different episodes of the popular American quiz show Jeopardy. Here I took all the answers from this test file to test the system once again.
- There is a Jupyter notebook file called jeopardy-test-questions-cleaning.ipynb which contains the process used to clean this dataset and extract the answers provided by participants to questions.

### Running the files
To run, simply clone this folder and run the script **assignment1-q1.ipynb**.
