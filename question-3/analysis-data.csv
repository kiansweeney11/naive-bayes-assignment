fellow critic once stated belief reviewer should speak himself own review ive attempted rule recent months do would impossible case fact nearly every person goes see phantom menace brings baggage them original star wars trilogy means much many people me my creativity child masterful original works art mix moving stories were astonishing special effects time still hold pretty darn well am too young seen star wars theater during original release doesnt make me any less dedicated contrary star wars trilogy empire strikes back particular three items very short list why love movies heard george lucas would making first trilogy series got exited first saw well over year ago embarked drool anticipation first previews were released last thanksgiving ready see then there hype insane marketing campaign lucasfilms secretive snobbery over picture last weeks before picture opened while fans waited outside theaters stood boiling sun days advance first ones theater tired hearing tired seeing cardboard cutouts characters whenever went taco bell wanted see reader do misunderstand did reaction hype unavoidable understand accept hype happens prequel most widely beloved films time get released five minutes into phantom menace knew there problem these jedi knights asked why churning stale dialogue machinegun why arent these characters being developed before adventures why there special effects shot nearly every frame entire these were my questions early later asked wheres magic first three films why am looking my watch every fifteen minutes end tired depressed george lucas own wonderful movies into pointless mindless summer blockbuster phantom menace no star wars take away title jedi talk force youre left easily most vacuous special effects movies time embarrassment looked desperately scene character explored new theme examined special effects shot isnt used there few each theyre token attempts fact george lucas created simultaneously abysmally bad excuse pretty good showcase digital effects wanted see didnt want leave phantom menace headache bitter taste my mouth did story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost confused apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor scarcely line attempts liberate people planet naboo naboo victim bureaucratic war trade federation contact naboo queen amidala natalie portman teenage ruler truly cares people after picking jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced ahmed best head tatooine where meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd mother pernilla august quigon knows force strong young anakin jedi knights take boy them journeys bad guys darth maul darth sidious neither whom enough lines register characters there isnt anything particularly wrong story looking synopsis form way lucas handled however unsatisfactory first we dont learn single thing quigon jinn thing life before well imagine didnt thats why feels plot device probably explains why neeson looks hopeless role why hes recently retired dont blame him honestly obiwan character really looking forward learning even less interesting mcgregor few lines anyone hoping see engaging young actor great performance urged look elsewhere since these two men focus phantom menace lucas served us big emotional void centerpiece things start pick our characters reach tatooine young anakin perhaps only truly fleshedout character lloyd does thoughtful job role also hugely impressed sand scene rarely action sequence fast exciting anakin says goodbye mother found moving also fairly good portman she manages give little depth character where no depth been written jar jar binks most annoying characters ive ever had endure hes interesting than most humans soon segment tatooine over back mindnumbing special effects depthless action scenes ive seen many movies qualify special effects extravaganzas phantom menace first ive seen had me sick special effects fifteen minutes into reason obvious george lucas no restraint cant say didnt find effects original because did final battle between darth maul obiwan quigon visually exceptional most also found effects deadening tiresome my breaking point near end picture anakin getting questioned yoda other jedi masters background we see hundreds digital spaceships flying around through digital sky wanted go away cant we stinking scene isnt bursting seems special effects shot got sick looking cgi characters spaceships planets backgrounds really wanted go outside look physical landscape few hours then theres question magic lost sixteen years between phantom menace return jedi feeling lucas focused how looked forgot entirely way should feel john williams familiar score no help nor lucas direction think comes right down characters there none here longed magnetic presence han luke leia got no such thing ridiculous expectations mine werent high simply wanted showed me roots films grew loving story had few characters few great special effects instead got two hours fifteen minutes lifeless

after blair witch thoroughly creeped me sixth sense mildly spooky then stir echoes had moments wasnt anything id lose sleep over clearly quality horror summer slowly been dropping then any surprise stigmata dullest most horribly executed piece tripe seen long while no really patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser pittsburgh receives rosary gift mother turns rosary belonged brazilian priest priests church had been under investigation father andrew gabriel byrne because mysterious appearance bleeding statue father investigator made career supposed religious signs time believes there something bleeding statue investigation soon called off however frankie starts exhibiting signs stigmata person inflicted wounds jesus christ father initially skeptical frankie s story considering shes atheist once witnesses stigmata attacks himself dedicates himself finding going eventually begins suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something could bring down catholic church turns dead priest had been working translation fifth gospel before were new rupert music video mean stigmata sort starts off ok only gets worse indeed would been good if were music video because only interesting five minutes im sure trying prove endless parade slowmotion extreme closeups other than fact most swelled head any director hollywood yes been school camera trickery interesting little while eventually becomes headacheinducing needed second audio track played over dialogue such screaming audience see look can do im excellent director maybe then hed explain why decided start half scenes slowmotion shots water dripping reverse why included random superfluous shots egg frying ooh scary if there underlying meaning behind camera trickery didnt see thought safe get involved story here comes shot two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed no reason whatsoever then again superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother me if stigmata had story characters were remotely engaging though vanity certainly doesnt help does seem been given nearly unworkable script where plot continuity character development need them case point frankie page character assume we supposed identify sympathize we arent given any back story character any reason extent character development seems she hardworking hairdresser can somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building shes kind cute lets start bleeding fact shes clearly brightest bulb drawer doesnt help either according frankie page first thing do after receiving mysterious wounds your back go sure makes sense arquette byrne pryce give old college try characters onedimensional appear sleepwalking scenes between arquette byrne were probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable even though frankie pages life falling apart before very eyes she still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon even curiously seems interested advances father andrews religious doubt pops suddenly seems silly than dramatic pryce may well wear mustache ill get my pretty depth cardinal houseman afforded trust me im revealing anything telling pryce turns villain whats worse after being faced dull characters prospect having annoying camera tricks loud music jammed down our throats we now contend story starts off direction veers off another then another ends being totally incomprehensible first doesnt even bother explain should very simple plot details how does frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary how come atheist chosen since father andrew mentions only very devout believers ever received stigmata actually im sure frankie supposedly stigmata occurs holy spirit later being dead priest later evil spirit think answer question course very simple possessing entity each scene determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wants use time furthermore ending ridiculously neat little wrapup filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning into diatribe against catholic church if do any research gospel st thomas youll find being church seems claim readily available your local library theres nothing catholics need worry though religion cant confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church if wanted portray catholic priests mobsters should gone allout equipped them suits tommy

8,actually am fan original 1961 flick same name starring mills twice pair twins separated birth divorcing parents never come contact other parents never meet again everyone should know how feel remakes especially films happen enjoy my fallacy unless youre going either capture same exact spirit original do something different maybe even both your brain come gasp new idea remake originally top my viewing list actually quite opposite contemporary films my anyway theyre usually unfunny alienating big fat bore least anyone over age 11 above iq 10 however shockingly bad fact actually good original good whats great doesnt necessarily retread original capture same exact spirit does become entertaining same exact reasons original entertaining because cute innocent fun because pretty killer plot endlessly fun follow along because lead star immensely appealing because parents also immensely appealing im repeating myself because cute innocent fun theres nothing too risque save plot idea separating twins denying them truth years ominously selfish precisely point aimed directly either kids adults want remember original young adults want remember kid personally am somewhere between second third can vividly remember my taste movies wasnt weird diverse names godard kubrick werent even glimmer my right eye back then would tune every sunday night couple years see abcs wonderful world disney where theyd show liveaction andor madefortv disney flick hour per week can remember my mom taking my sister along my friends mothers see rereleased disney films lady tramp most sadly remember every single christmas without fail there were childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively christmas season wouldnt dare missing can even remember seeing madefortv parent trap ii tv night after had seen over over over again saw original parent trap late childhood because deals issue divorce deals disneyized version playful witty charming if saw first time right now having never experienced part my childhood id probably dismiss id probably do same new version same if hadnt seen original such perfect age watching could remember fun watch disney how divorce me started get me thinking possibilities my parents splitting how affected my adolescence also how brushed fear off smooth stroke pointed even most situations things could always work if well manipulate things bit least better new version did me also charming own way new cast contemporary feel first time awhile flick tone isnt corny condescending right moments would otherwise seem corny actually affecting safe kind way first time since original kids actually know better than foolish adults story basically classic now repeated almost many times kurosawas seven samurai pair twins played here lindsay were played mills original separated birth divorcing parents annie sent live mother natasha richardson resembling mother vanessa redgrave than had ever noticed london where she lives parents devoted foppish butler simon she works swingin fashion designer she grows refined classy also keen knowledge sports pokerplaying other hallie sent northern california father dennis quaid live lisa ann walter grows rugged yet charming both meet same camp annie wants go become rugged feud because look alltoo similar thus tight competition results nasty pranks winds them seclusion together private cabin there become friends then learn eachother once know everything concoct scheme switch places can meet other parent whom theyve only heard learn lives detail make sure look alike requires hair cutting notoriously scene kiddie version hypodermic needle scene pulp fiction end summer comes switch hope best lindsay doesnt necessarily copy acting style mills original she comes off appealing she did once she does though add couple new things she makes california twin little appealing london twin bit frank snobbish than snotty proper original respectively she also adds american british accent each faking other accent throughout if really take notice can see fake ones accents arent exactly perfect shes also incredibly appealing merely cute especially notable since first feature we know how notorious child actors especially first films she makes great protagonist only helps supporting cast equally appealing dennis quaid fact hasnt been likable decade big dumb smile near cocky attitude made him notable actor past hes mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except she hasnt ever been likable period two make winning couple maybe winning maureen ohara late brian keith original still work instead bickering ensued original adds another dimension another angle characters amiss original during opening credits we see glimpses courtship where fall quickly madly love eachother back together again films smarmy scenes come off actually sentimental great way way many such films brings new parent trap level entertainment hasnt really existed since well original years ago still my money best flick time because form intelligence wit makes such plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot sharon stone type played elaine hendrix whos deliciously tormented twins later treat instead bore original transcends crap very well could case point takes two starring olsen twins because treats children smart ones adults silly ones other way around because above everything knows exactly how charming without biting off than can chew however comparison original could bit better certain scenes work well nearly well worked original liked way parents fought over past then fought over falling love again better than liked watching two old flames getting back together over bottle wine somehow feuding always cinematic pleasing than mere lesson extracted howard grant films yesteryear much transcends mere compared original almost drowns original though gritty far stylized suitable adult audiences young audiences such remake may never nearly great classic original least knows how treat source material dignity respect how create virtually same effects without bordering petty annoyances,1,1,-10874.688457391594,-10880.48534558858,1

same mistake we see him these stages smart teenager vicious hate man having epiphany man tries correct hes done before these we get portrait man sides least thats intention films framing device brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking 13 also now skinhead how principal bob sweeney avery brooks found captain star treks deep space 9 trying correct him opens danny written book report

intelligent still very rough along edges hes hes no longer controlled anger blacks jews tries persuade danny whos becoming derek before give lifestyle danny wont goes large skinhead beer bash meets skinhead leader stacy keach then discovers derek opposed couple years ago circles around then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks done black white we mostly see derek prime skinhead living venice beach organizing vicious raids local stores no longer hire white middleclass teenagers since can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants do same work mouthing off theories affirmative action how illegal immigrants blacks destroyed fundamentals country built them white man gotten fuzzy end only speaks forcefully intelligently backs everything political reasons justifying rage least them frighteningly enough much says sounds true american history x collection really great scenes moments rather than cohesive great flows effortlessly moment next there best scenes ive seen year scene features dinner between dereks family mothers newest boyfriend played reserve gould jewish liberal quietly disagrees dereks views launching scene into fit rage anger builds emotions audience goulds reaction dereks final summation another scene uses humor traditional macho sex talk build friendship nice connection between derek black coworker guy torry while folding laundry prison another actually divided two murder two black men winds derek jail contains final murder nasty may most shocking year theres much appreciate acting uniformly good standouts coming avery brooks beverly dangelo longsuffering mother gould horrible line other than comes off best performance hes given seems really long time norton walks off though coming off such intensity reduces anyone doing adequate job rubble only fifth career norton invented himself most reliable intense actors generation maybe best theres nothing norton really gets rolling spewing lines such authority commands attention audience coming off power similar young brando allows little emotions seep through amazing sadly enough isnt going great portrait racism perhaps hopes too unambitious even little contrived really take off either powerful statement emotional masterpiece ending especially other movies tossed emotional keyboard can upon skinheads reduced mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan fairs rather annoyingly fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail expressing desire eat even dramatic arc isnt well travelled danny never seems really learning lesson since flashbacks refuse show point view decides make change end inevitable doesnt seem actually arrived there even dereks descent into doesnt seem justified though fireman father william russ dad boy meets world dont ask me how know killed black junkie even before spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems any real back story why derek became intense beliefs such can see why director tony kaye wanted name removed sorta american history x very good very moved could lot better problem seems cut claims potential somewhere claims there lies tony kaye cut true cut until viewed norton then ordered another cut thus although aimed directing credit go alan smithee resident name any disowned director wasnt allowed him under grounds once disown can really thats macguffin no really wanted good given alan smithee sign disapproval kayes right par even if hes referring normal par rather own personal par will do right thing late 90s yet still gets point across intelligently backs story message cannot ones own beliefs pain suffering will occur literally said over narration unfortunately even if isnt perfect least avery brooks turns norton after been beaten raped prison asks him if anything hes done made life any better hits nerve only derek

46,star wars episode 1 phantom menace 1999 review matt few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm affection george lucas 1977 classic star wars original blockbuster two sequels only evoked wonder passion generation filmgoers deeply entrenched itself american pop culture arguably americans today can explain force jedi than budget deficit 22 years after release original 16 years since third return jedi how can any new star wars withstand weight incomparable expectations anticipation can new storyline new cast characters possibly compete legends first trilogy luke han solo darth vader cultural icons against challenge fourth star wars episode phantom menace hit screens last week despite early critical reviews major media neither flop nor disappointment while phantom menace certainly finest series nonetheless engaging exciting visually breathtaking worthy sequel er prequel original star wars films phantom menace takes place decades before setting original films opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor wise old master introduced luke force original star wars only young jedi apprentice still learning fellow jedi instructor quigon jinn liam neeson republic government sent two jedi settle trade dispute developed into blockade planet naboo shifty trade federation jedi quickly find themselves negotiations middle planetary invasion rushing protect naboos young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala helping escape naboo forced stop tatooine repair ship before bringing galactic senate make appeal justice tatooine quigon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd only can help them get parts need displays uncanny intelligence insight instincts quigon senses child unusually strong force begins suspect may prophesized bring balance force anyone watched original star wars trilogy knows far being galactic savior will time become ruthless darth vader complicating matters further mysterious hooded figure darth sidious behind trade blockade invasion naboo sends lethal apprentice darth maul find capture queen amidala while amidala jedi fight save planet soon also deal deadly relentless darth maul if plot sounds bit complicated phantom menace only introduces earlier generation characters immediate crisis sets foundation events will eventually lead fall republic demise jedi knights anakins turn evil rise dark empire original trilogy complexity overwhelming story moves quickly only drawback being many questions predictably remain unanswered end setting stage next episode reasons films story seems hazy too confusing too unfocused unclear whose story phantom menace original trilogy movies were clearly lukes story stories centering around growth rebel hero jedi knight unclear whether new anakins story if trilogy centered anakin shaky foundation lloyd many child actors lacks subtle acting skills adult performers result character seems shallow unimpressive screen we see nothing suggests dark side lurking underneath face matter any presence would make him seem special quigon willing believe rest cast does fine though often work iffy dialogue lucas neeson perfect aging jedi knight mcgregor wellcast obiwan conveys balance youthful energy calm sensibility portman fits role young queen well lines were often very formal giving little room give character much personality biggest problem phantom menace plot characters interaction between them individually characters new no less developed than those original star wars storyline confusing than previous films series unlike previous trilogy lucas doesnt do good job playing characters off another star wars there were immediate contrasts memorable exchanges between luke han han obiwan leia luke ensemble played off each other immediately showed distinct attitudes personalities sequence where luke han chewbacca attempt rescue leia cell death star audience learns lot four characters ways react immediate problems each other there no comparable sequence phantom menace flesh characters relationships each other individually interesting characters clear motivations interests lucas develops little chemistry tension between them perhaps most glaring weakness probably reason disappointed many reviewers despite need richer dialogue stronger character interaction still very engaging many wonderful elements lucas previous films make phantom menace both memorable entertaining first course remarkably rich imaginative universe lucas creates characters visit magical underwater cities evade sea monsters fight battle droids menacing destroyers planet naboo watch spectacular event part race part circuit arid desert planet tatooine then head gothic urban capital republic home galactic senate jedi council each location elaborate complex lucas never settles vague ideas look settings creates rich spectacular landscapes most new special effects rereleased special edition trilogy 1997 were changes allowed him give earlier movies look feel werent possible films were made than ever new lucas universe filled menagerie creatures robots personalities supporting cast aliens interact main characters best such character greedy tatooine junk dealer

humor can easily missed finally phantom menace works because films there no shortage speed action beginning end there lightsaber battles hairraising chases thrilling duels between good evil sequence tatooine most entertaining exciting scenes any star wars final showdown between obiwan quigon darth maul arguably best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas filmed phantom menace wont win any major oscars probably wont beat titanics box office record even best star wars id put third after original empire strikes back exciting entertaining far better than your typical summer blockbuster

films 50s 60s even become them however we learned 1995 sometimes expectations can shattered lot criticism gone against read far two reviews makes me wonder why these types films automatically dismissed gory laughable pieces trash thing isnt well made well acted quite intelligent can see most critics now complaining level gore level sexuality species series isnt lack these elements how much can get into yet behind basic premise allows get away doing species ii begins present day though seems alternate universe many films especially scifi ones create similar our realistic change fit films needs species ii begins arrival american spacecraft excursion landing surface mars aboard patrick ross justin lazard very bright very handsome astronaut patrick son senator ross james cromwell wants patrick succeed well would seem succeeded landing surface mars first human being ever do course isnt first ever billion years ago alien species supposedly landed mars destroyed perfect living conditions were able sustain life now course red planet cold rocky no life lives no visible life patrick upon leaving spacecraft landing red soil collects samples ground takes them aboard puts them storage unfortunately samples contains form life gets loose heated aboard ship prior heading back earth life form creeps along floor inhabits earthlings pass approximately seven minutes then shrug off nothing because cant even remember blame technical malfunction back earth patrick begins strong urges mate many women possible we know original because alien wants breed take over planet however children halfhuman father patrick really looking another alien breed finds eve natasha henstridge eve cloned dna taken sil original alien however time around most alien urges been either dramatically lie dormant project led dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising role species motives seem respectable since she involved original alien attack she wants learn how stop alien should come again storywise species ii much stronger than predecessor also much stronger than say aliens hey love cant tell me strong story surprised me most historical facts into screenplay my search extraterrestrial intelligence course college we learned piece rock mars landed poles piece rock contained may been proof life mars later proven living creature created script uses effectively also manages provide plot beginning first man mars something always dreamed seeing hoping would turn element into useful starting point does quite well characters smart know do do only character seems little cliched general george dzundza yet remains logical everything does there obvious flaws course mostly lying technical aspects special effects only mediocre plain bad most part remain believable even noticed homage alien series mothers gave birth alien children also most realistic ones usually goriest ranging people being torn open someones head being blown off however plot elements also may elicit laughs audience including menage troi necessary many people dislike species series because excuse sex nudity gory violence however tend disagree were alien films if alien species ever did come earth sole purpose destroy us wouldnt mate quickly possible many people possible my only gripe during scene where patrick goes searching mate grocery store didnt realize aliens were picky choosing women mate assume side looking most beautiful acting quite good kind vast improvement over first least acting key element if bad would lowered itself into camp if good would asked comparison films aliens okay isnt good george dzundza probably most obvious mistake casting overthetop impersonation general makes him annoying distracting natasha henstridge limited time around she usually enclosed cage however she does manage very impressive performance aspect hindering any talent oh yeah shes quite fun plain watch marg helgenberger immensely better time around performance probably best michael madsen soso isnt annoying soon becomes rather appealing nice personality james cromwell small part makes much better than could been incapable actor say any james cromwell dramatically increases likeability mykelti williamson gives enjoyable performance gives downtoearth feel course justin lazard lazard far been ridiculed performance think effective sure wooden isnt character moment touches glass separating henstridge him extremely well done due couples acting species ii rated r strong sexuality scifi violencegore language definitely r rated young kids should see than likely would probably nightmares never sex rest lives hell dont even know if will sure critically lambasted turns surprise year probably wont see another where expecting little got much quite while director peter medak crafted very suspenseful sometimes very scary mediocre series medak also mastered wonderful jump moments probably second scariest moment ever seen scream still first strong acting smart dialogue
