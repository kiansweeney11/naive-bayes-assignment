    "Without context this is an overwhelmingly positive phrase in which the positive probability would score highly. The context here being the sentence begins with the it being \"a sad state of affairs\" when the movie lacks excitement. The next few sentences contain uncommon names and phrases that would be neutral looking on the onside with regards to positive / negative sentiment. Another set of words I feel that might skew the probability slightly towards positive classification are:\n",

    "***good enough to be enjoyable***\n",

    "Despite the presence of \"nor\" just before this phrase taken in isolation this phrase would be seen as positive without doubt. The rest of this sentence is also very clearly negative sentiment but this part of the phrase would definitely be seen as positive. I feel also looking at the text stop words play a key word in helping identify the sentiment. They bring us on to the writers main points and help direct the negative sentiment more accurately. Looking at how the Naive-Bayes polarity classifier works here in that it focuses on the frequency of the word this may help tell us why this document was wrongly classified."

    "### Second Incorrect Prediction Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We are once again focusing on an incorrect prediction involving a negative document labelled as positive. This is another movie review but certainly done in a different style to our previous analysis. It has a slightly larger disparity in positive and negative total probabilities here than the previous document, albeit with more unique words. This piece more tells the story of the film for the first half of the text and really is harder to tell which text would sway the positive or negative sentiments our Naive-Bayes classifier detects. The first clearly negative piece of text can be seen here:\n",
    "\n",
    "***this movie is not original at all in fact i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and arguably the best gangster movie of all time the godfather if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit why not borrow from a lesser known movie say millers crossing how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself here are just some of the major similarities i stopped counting at 10***\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I think the Naive-Bayes classifier would struggle with picking up some of the quite clear negative sentiment here. Looking at the cells below this clarifies this point further. Three of the four words have higher psoitive probabilities here and overall this phrase \"not original at all\" would be classed as positive. The way Naive-Bayes works, focusing on individual words and their occurrences misses phrases like this and with a relatively small difference in probabilities between positive and negative ratings for this document phrases like this become key."

    "Reading through the full text of this document I feel it can be identified in a few locations where our Naive-Bayes classifier detects negative sentiment.

These include sentences such as:\n",

    "This use of negation here may struggle to be picked up and as we see below in our cells the word \"fails\" has an overwhelmingly majority in negative probability. In other language models the phrase \"never fails to\" (\"never ceases to\" etc.) could automatically be labelled as positive whereas as discussed earlier in our Naive-Bayes classifier where individual words are focused on we cannot tell the sentiment. Another phrase that could be interpreted as negative is:\n",

    "Our Naive-Bayes classifier appears to be able to pick up negation used here (\"not one original or interesting\") and help classify it as negative sentiment as it could most definitely pick up the use of interesting here and make this sentence positive. We also see very strong expressions to describe characters such as \"simply horrible\" to describe one of the main characters in the film and see further use of negation here:\n",

    "***its not entertaining and its not even a good time passer the hour and a half***\n",

    "We see another large disparity in positive and negative probability scores here despite it being a small document in terms of content. It is not as clear here as before from the start as to why this is clearly a negative document. There is a lot of unique names here in this document based on characters within the document which would not contribute very highly to the probability (\"richelieu stephen rea\" etc) but there is a few words amongst all that set a negative tone. There is a couple of words such as \"weak\" and \"conniving\" that would skew the probability of words slightly. The aforementioned names also would skew our results here I feel. The fact that these would all have better scores for negative probabilities like the word \"xinxin\" demonstrated below is another reason why I feel our Naive-Bayes classifier accurately predicts this document as negative. There is quite a few of these in this document so that would definitely be a factor. Other phrases such as \"totally lacking\" would I feel also skew the probability towards a more negative prediction."

    "This document certainly takes to detect any positive or negative sentiment within it. There is basically a run of the plot for the first few sentences which to many reading it hints at a negative classification (\"regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guys head and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder\"). However, after this brief summary of the film we start to see some much more positive sentiment expressed. There are some uber positive words used such \"thoughtprovoking\", \"complex\", \"realistic\", \"authentic\" and \"superb\" used in the piece. As demonstrated below these are all clearly positive words and even like the previous document mentioned with names that only seem to appear in this document which would label them as positive in the training data and hence make them positive in the document. Other phrases such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "***one of the best movies of this decade and i emphatically recommend the apostle***\n",
    "\n",
    "would certainly gather a strong positivity score too. \"Emphatically\" only appears once in the training corpus so again this would help swing the positive score overall I feel."

After this there is definitely enough what could be regarded as negative words such as \"untraditional and deceptive\", \"frightened\" and \"disgusted\". However, as per below some of these words seem to be regarded as positive below which could be seen as surprising. For the rest of the piece we again see what would be predominately high probability words scattered throughout. Some of these are referenced below such as \"compelling\" and \"impressive\" which I feel help tip the balance towards a positive prediction here. "

    "\n",
    "while \"sensational\" is also used to describe elements of the film. As we only take unique words for our classifier these words are all different ways to highlight approval of the film and express positive sentiment. Further positive words such as \"extraordinary\" and \"asthonishing\" can be seen used in the document as well and adding all these unique positive words together it is easy to see why this document was overwhelmingly scored as positive by our classifier. A lot of these words would not have high negative probabilities also which would contribute to the labelling of this document as positive also.\n"
